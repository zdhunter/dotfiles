2015-09-13 23:27:45	Pinkamena_D	I haven't heard of that being possible 
2015-09-13 23:28:45	Pinkamena_D	And incase anyone cares about that question I asked an hour ago, it was an issue with watchdog. This is the solution (not by me). I had to make some minor edits because of the other updated to the library: https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog/commit/e4eebae522e2e6fc9448de12a8a15e924ed684e9
