2016-03-16 18:11:35	StereoBucket	anyway TRON how do I use this thing you linked 
2016-03-16 18:11:58	@TRON	it's right there on the manual
2016-03-16 18:12:12	@TRON	"You can simply run avr-nm on your output (ELF) file. Run it with the -n option, and it will sort the symbols numerically (by default, they are sorted alphabetically)."
2016-03-16 18:12:26	@TRON	"Look for the symbol _end, that's the first address in RAM that is not allocated by a variable."
2016-03-16 18:13:22	StereoBucket	Yeah the problem is I don't know how to do that. 
2016-03-16 18:14:07	StereoBucket	wew,compiler warnings are disabled by arduino IDE.
2016-03-16 18:14:28	StereoBucket	I wonder if thats the reason everything looks good most of the time
2016-03-16 18:18:26	@TRON	you don't know how to run a command
2016-03-16 18:18:29	@TRON	on a terminal

2016-03-16 18:19:39	&indi	^_^;
2016-03-16 18:19:45	StereoBucket	I located avr-nm now I'm trying to find what it does with binaries
2016-03-16 18:20:12	@TRON	probably on the same directory it keeps the hex file at
2016-03-16 18:20:25	StereoBucket	Seems like it may be a temporary folder

2016-03-16 18:23:11	StereoBucket	whats up with microchip

2016-03-16 18:23:49	@TRON	unlike atmel, microchip doesn't give away free compilers
2016-03-16 18:23:52	@TRON	they sell the stuff
2016-03-16 18:23:58	@TRON	moreover
2016-03-16 18:24:16	@TRON	AVR microcontrollers are vastly inferior to microchip's PIC32 cores
2016-03-16 18:24:28	@TRON	there's really no reason to keep them around
2016-03-16 18:24:57	StereoBucket	I found the elf file
2016-03-16 18:25:15	@TRON	now run avr-nm -n on it
2016-03-16 18:25:22	@TRON	and look for _end
2016-03-16 18:25:42	@TRON	subtract 0x800000 from it
2016-03-16 18:25:56	@TRON	and the space from there to RAMEND is how much SRAM you have left over
2016-03-16 18:26:12	@TRON	[that RAM is shared between the stack and heap]
2016-03-16 18:26:35	@TRON	if you really are concerned about your dynamic RAM usage
2016-03-16 18:26:43	@TRON	you can eitehr get a debugger and watch the _end symbol
2016-03-16 18:26:58	@TRON	or you can do a hack and

2016-03-16 18:27:27	@TRON	as for the stack pointer, it is a pair of registers inside the MCU
2016-03-16 18:27:33	@TRON	SPH and SPL, iirc
2016-03-16 18:28:17	@TRON	http://www.avr-asm-tutorial.net/avr_gra/ports_m8.gif   <-- yep
2016-03-16 18:28:22	@TRON	right below SREG
2016-03-16 18:29:14	@TRON	so you can actually read the stack pointer by just reading from absolute address 0x5d and 0x5e
2016-03-16 18:30:03	@TRON	#define STACK_POINTER *((volatile uint16_t*)0x5d)
2016-03-16 18:30:34	@TRON	mind you, i would go with a debugger instead
2016-03-16 18:30:51	@TRON	[then again, arduino is so mediocre that not even the hardware comes with a debugger]
2016-03-16 18:32:00	StereoBucket	Might need something better than this modern looking IDE aswell

2016-03-16 18:33:51	@TRON	now, find RAMEND
2016-03-16 18:33:57	@TRON	[the top address in RAM]
2016-03-16 18:34:23	@TRON	since you have 2k = 2048 bytes = 0x800
2016-03-16 18:34:40	StereoBucket	this was compiled for Mega which has 8 k of ram
2016-03-16 18:35:26	@TRON	so you have about 7.5k shared between the stack and heap
2016-03-16 18:36:17	Behemoth	do u guys use IDEs

2016-03-16 18:41:34	@TRON	you can still code an AVR chip

2016-03-16 18:43:05	Behemoth	or what
2016-03-16 18:43:19	@TRON	they still clock them at 16MHz to keep compatibility with the first arduino board

2016-03-16 18:45:04	@TRON	then, come the arduino uno

2016-03-16 18:45:45	alex1	they are cheap anough to justify their shitty performance
2016-03-16 18:46:04	@TRON	really? because the MSP430 experimenter boards from TI are even cheaper
2016-03-16 18:46:09	@TRON	and miles ahead of the arduino

2016-03-16 18:50:17	StereoBucket_	I dunno they put those 2 together ,cause, reasons
2016-03-16 18:50:20	@TRON	you need to supply 5V to the atmega chip for it to run at 16MHz
2016-03-16 18:50:28	@TRON	so now you have to bridge the two voltages
2016-03-16 18:50:31	@TRON	and as a kicker
2016-03-16 18:50:47	@TRON	the stuff that you use with the atmega you can't use with the sitara
