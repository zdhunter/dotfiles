2015-09-07 02:44:39	[14]Chaosvex	It's not going to be
2015-09-07 02:45:05	[14]Chaosvex	The dev that controls the code works abroad and has no time to talk to me
2015-09-07 02:45:09	TinoDidriksen	Have you asked directly about the lack of C++ part?
2015-09-07 02:45:29	[14]Chaosvex	TinoDidriksen, no - I think they just don't know the difference between C89 and C++
2015-09-07 02:45:40	[14]Chaosvex	They're not technical
2015-09-07 02:45:46	Paprikachu	at least give them a heads-up when you leave
2015-09-07 02:45:56	[14]Chaosvex	About what?
2015-09-07 02:46:07	Paprikachu	everything that sucks.
2015-09-07 02:46:17	[14]Chaosvex	Eh, there's no point in that
2015-09-07 02:46:35	TinoDidriksen	Yes there is, or the next guy will go into it blind as well.
2015-09-07 02:46:37	[14]Chaosvex	Alarm bells rang when I was told the other dev would try to dig out the compiler CD this week
2015-09-07 02:46:53	TinoDidriksen	Oh wow
2015-09-07 02:48:25	TheSchaf	compiler cd? :D
2015-09-07 02:48:29	TheSchaf	with what? borland 6?
2015-09-07 02:48:38	[14]Chaosvex	It's some really old proprietary compiler - can't get it online
2015-09-07 02:48:42	Paprikachu	cd?
2015-09-07 02:48:44	[14]Chaosvex	Yes
2015-09-07 02:49:00	Paprikachu	oh, we're talking about disks
2015-09-07 02:49:03	[14]Chaosvex	They don't have it at the office though - it's with the dev (he's abroad, as said)
2015-09-07 02:49:07	Paprikachu	i just realized that
2015-09-07 02:49:18	Paprikachu	took me a while to figure that out :DD
2015-09-07 02:49:22	[14]Chaosvex	=D
2015-09-07 02:50:12	Paprikachu	[14]Chaosvex: write a new compiler for them
2015-09-07 02:50:16	[14]Chaosvex	;)
2015-09-07 02:50:24	Paprikachu	what platform is this for anyways?
2015-09-07 02:50:34	[14]Chaosvex	Embedded stuff
2015-09-07 02:50:44	Paprikachu	yeah, but what kind of embedded
2015-09-07 02:50:57	Paprikachu	like what processor
2015-09-07 02:51:07	[14]Chaosvex	Just small 8-bit ones
2015-09-07 02:51:15	[14]Chaosvex	Not ARM, if that's what you're asking
2015-09-07 02:51:35	Paprikachu	and what is that stuff used for?
2015-09-07 02:51:48	[14]Chaosvex	Controlling motors, mostly
2015-09-07 02:52:06	Paprikachu	weird shit.
2015-09-07 02:52:33	Paprikachu	do you know what the compiler is called?
2015-09-07 02:52:38	Paprikachu	i want to look that stuff up :D
2015-09-07 02:53:05	[14]Chaosvex	It's an MPLAB compiler
2015-09-07 02:53:24	[14]Chaosvex	(Not the ones on the site)
2015-09-07 02:53:55	[14]Chaosvex	There's no C++ support available for the chips, so any hopes of moving things on are dashed
2015-09-07 02:54:06	TheSchaf	did u look in http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/devtools/dev-tools-parts.html
2015-09-07 02:54:17	[14]Chaosvex	TheSchaf, yes, it's not available
2015-09-07 02:55:43	Paprikachu	[14]Chaosvex: so, what's next?
2015-09-07 02:56:29	[14]Chaosvex	A more attractive company made positions available last week, apparently
2015-09-07 02:56:46	[14]Chaosvex	It's not C++ either but at least the wage is higher and they have a better work environment
2015-09-07 02:57:01	TheSchaf	so whats it there?
2015-09-07 02:57:10	[14]Chaosvex	TheSchaf, language?
2015-09-07 02:57:15	TheSchaf	ye
2015-09-07 02:57:18	[14]Chaosvex	Mostly Python
2015-09-07 02:57:30	TheSchaf	thats not too bad i guess
2015-09-07 02:57:55	Paprikachu	do you even python?
2015-09-07 02:58:15	[14]Chaosvex	I know a small amount but they don't require Python skills
2015-09-07 02:58:25	Paprikachu	:D
2015-09-07 02:58:28	[14]Chaosvex	They provide training in it for a few weeks
2015-09-07 02:58:55	[14]Chaosvex	It's Python. How hard can it be? ;)
2015-09-07 02:59:02	TheSchaf	training training training
2015-09-07 02:59:28	Paprikachu	well, at least you won't have to deal with multithreading issues
2015-09-07 02:59:35	[14]Chaosvex	True that
2015-09-07 02:59:40	[14]Chaosvex	Just put a global lock around everything

2015-09-07 03:02:52	[14]Chaosvex	Don't even
2015-09-07 03:03:03	Paprikachu	shouldnt be *that* hard, considering that the ps4 is just a branded pc, right?
2015-09-07 03:03:19	[14]Chaosvex	Yes and no
2015-09-07 03:03:19	TheSchaf	is ps4 security even broken yet?
2015-09-07 03:03:24	[14]Chaosvex	Yes, it's an x86 CPU
2015-09-07 03:03:34	[14]Chaosvex	No, it has a different memory model
2015-09-07 03:03:43	Paprikachu	:/
2015-09-07 03:03:50	[14]Chaosvex	TheSchaf, no
2015-09-07 03:04:05	[14]Chaosvex	Just need to wait for an overflow in a game!
2015-09-07 03:04:43	TheSchaf	well if its 100% uncracked it still should be in a state where all stuff is fully encrypted etc
2015-09-07 03:04:59	Paprikachu	consoles need to die.
2015-09-07 03:05:32	TheSchaf	i played 8 hours of pokemon on my flight to the US

2015-09-07 03:06:33	TinoDidriksen	Wow
2015-09-07 03:06:37	TheSchaf	and it still only has one save slot

2015-09-07 03:06:44	TheSchaf	which is why it prob. doesnt autosave :P

2015-09-07 03:31:37	Ensiferum	the original problem was to send a protobuf message to a application in phone
2015-09-07 03:31:45	Ensiferum	and basically im looking at installing windows now.

2015-09-07 03:36:32	Ensiferum	TinoDidriksen: hm?
2015-09-07 03:36:33	Rusty^	yup but it's still funny :)

2015-09-07 03:37:01	TinoDidriksen	"News"paper
2015-09-07 03:37:44	TinoDidriksen	Ensiferum, how does protobuf end up with installing Windows?
2015-09-07 03:38:10	Ensiferum	TinoDidriksen: the application doesnt react to the message, so need to use logcat to view the logs
2015-09-07 03:38:18	Ensiferum	but logcat doesnt ofc work, unless you're su
2015-09-07 03:38:24	Ensiferum	which means i gotta root the phone
2015-09-07 03:38:36	Ensiferum	and in order to root the phone (based on the instructions I found) i need some Odin windows software
2015-09-07 03:38:40	Ensiferum	which means I have to install windows
2015-09-07 03:38:43	Ensiferum	blah
2015-09-07 03:39:03	TinoDidriksen	What? You can logcat from adb without root.
2015-09-07 03:39:16	Ensiferum	TinoDidriksen: yeah and theres no fucking information.
2015-09-07 03:40:18	TinoDidriksen	Blame the app? If it doesn't print to stdout or log, you won't get anything.
2015-09-07 03:40:25	TinoDidriksen	*stderr
2015-09-07 03:40:45	Ensiferum	if you're root you can get more stuff from logcat
2015-09-07 03:40:46	Ensiferum	apprently
2015-09-07 03:40:53	Ensiferum	and then you get the logs from the app
2015-09-07 03:41:09	TinoDidriksen	Fair 'nuff
2015-09-07 03:41:13	Ensiferum	no su, fu!
2015-09-07 03:43:06	TinoDidriksen	Or use Heimdall from Linux.
2015-09-07 03:44:09	Ensiferum	what the fuck is that?
2015-09-07 03:44:25	TinoDidriksen	The open-source version of Odin.
2015-09-07 03:44:38	Ensiferum	:))))
2015-09-07 03:44:46	Ensiferum	i know how this is going to end
2015-09-07 03:44:56	Ensiferum	then im going to spend the next day fixing some build issues
2015-09-07 03:45:20	Ensiferum	+2 steps to the yak shaving stack
2015-09-07 03:45:41	TinoDidriksen	There are binaries.
2015-09-07 03:45:46	Ensiferum	it will segfault
2015-09-07 03:45:48	Ensiferum	why try
2015-09-07 03:50:10	Ensiferum	sometimes I wonder
2015-09-07 03:50:18	Ensiferum	why in the fuck I bother with this shit for living.
2015-09-07 03:50:23	Ensiferum	there must be way better jobs there

2015-09-07 06:45:24	[14]Chaosvex	Literally everything sucked
2015-09-07 06:45:27	Elles`w	Id try some embeded C
2015-09-07 06:45:38	Elles`w	its like a very primitive cpp
2015-09-07 06:45:49	ocZio	often you are confined to use the manufacturer's software when building

2015-09-07 07:31:54	epyx	Paprikachu, you told me before that it was a bad idea to use some_vector.at(i)
2015-09-07 07:32:00	Paprikachu	correct
2015-09-07 07:32:10	epyx	was this because the application wouldn't crash at failure?
2015-09-07 07:32:20	Paprikachu	it's because out of bounds access is always an error
2015-09-07 07:32:32	Paprikachu	and by calling .at you are acting like it is a legitimate thing
2015-09-07 07:32:36	[14]Chaosvex	I think it's a 'bad' idea in the sense that you probably don't really need it if you design stuff properly
2015-09-07 07:32:45	[14]Chaosvex	Always an exception (no pun intended) but still
2015-09-07 07:32:54	Paprikachu	if i is coming from a user, you always want to check it manually
2015-09-07 07:32:57	epyx	right
2015-09-07 07:33:07	Paprikachu	and if it isn't and you still access out of bounds, you have a bug
2015-09-07 07:33:17	Paprikachu	and in that case it should crash.

2015-09-07 08:27:02	TinoDidriksen	foo_, C++ is great for video games.
2015-09-07 08:27:14	Paprikachu	foo_: if you use java for vidya games, you end up with minecraft.

2015-09-07 08:27:17	TinoDidriksen	foo_, though, how small? You may be better off just using Unity.

2015-09-07 08:27:48	epyx	I might be crucified but if you're a beginner at programming in general I'd recommend Python + pyGame :)

2015-09-07 08:30:16	Paprikachu	because java.
2015-09-07 08:30:21	ocZio	foo_ but you will be lonely at the end

2015-09-07 08:31:29	Paprikachu	any kind of tree really.

2015-09-07 08:31:49	Paprikachu	minecraft is very computationally expensive.
2015-09-07 08:31:53	TinoDidriksen	...why do you even...
2015-09-07 08:31:53	ocZio	Paprikachu: are you trying to do SLI ?
2015-09-07 08:31:55	[14]Chaosvex	It has advanced features such as shaders and std::function
2015-09-07 08:31:57	Paprikachu	don't underestimate the amount of voxels.
2015-09-07 08:31:59	Paprikachu	ocZio: no
2015-09-07 08:32:13	foo_	Oh !  i found something interesting
2015-09-07 08:32:16	bum	yet still runs fine on basically every PC i've ever ran it on since uh it came out
2015-09-07 08:32:20	foo_	is Irrlicht a good engine ?
2015-09-07 08:32:29	Paprikachu	not for voxel games.
2015-09-07 08:32:33	foo_	arf
2015-09-07 08:32:35	TinoDidriksen	Is Irrlicht still developed?
2015-09-07 08:32:44	Paprikachu	ocZio: gpuz reports x16
2015-09-07 08:32:49	Paprikachu	but that can't be true
2015-09-07 08:32:49	[14]Chaosvex	Was Irrlicht ever a good engine?
2015-09-07 08:32:52	foo_	mmmh, i don't know :/
2015-09-07 08:32:54	Paprikachu	i also have a sound card.
2015-09-07 08:33:06	Paprikachu	irrlicht is easy to get started with, though it has some major design flaws.
2015-09-07 08:33:25	Paprikachu	foo_: if you're going to do voxel stuff, either write your own, or look into voxel engines specifically (i'd write my own)
2015-09-07 08:33:51	foo_	ok, ty Paprikachu
2015-09-07 08:33:52	ocZio	Paprikachu: which version?
2015-09-07 08:33:57	TinoDidriksen	Start with Unity. It'll let you do a lot of things, including Minecraft-style: http://google.com/search?q=Unity+Minecraft+clone
2015-09-07 08:33:58	ocZio	pcie 2.0 ? 3.0 ?
2015-09-07 08:33:59	bum	there must be some libraries out there that take advantage of the GPU for voxels
2015-09-07 08:34:05	Paprikachu	ocZio: 3.0
2015-09-07 08:34:31	foo_	Well i think i'll have to buy a new computer if i want to run unity or unreal :P
2015-09-07 08:34:33	ocZio	you are probably lowered to 8+8
2015-09-07 08:34:44	ocZio	you have tests you can run iiirc, furmark or something
2015-09-07 08:34:49	ocZio	try with and without your sound card
2015-09-07 08:34:52	ocZio	see the difference :)
2015-09-07 08:35:02	Paprikachu	meh, too much work :D
2015-09-07 08:35:15	Paprikachu	ill just hope that my setup will still work once i add a third card.
2015-09-07 08:35:19	Codex_	foo_: http://sivut.koti.soon.fi/~terop/test.html
2015-09-07 08:35:23	ocZio	what are you trying to achieve?
2015-09-07 08:35:25	ocZio	higher fps? 
2015-09-07 08:35:30	Paprikachu	afaik the intel ssd uses x4 and the sound card too.
2015-09-07 08:35:42	Paprikachu	ocZio: nothing, i just want to know if my system is going to work :P
2015-09-07 08:36:49	foo_	Nice ! Unity seems a good tool ! :D
2015-09-07 08:36:53	Paprikachu	i guess it will work.
2015-09-07 08:37:06	Paprikachu	sound card seems to use x4, pcie ssd uses x4.
2015-09-07 08:37:09	Paprikachu	gpu can run on x8.
2015-09-07 08:37:33	[14]Chaosvex	Blame Intel
2015-09-07 08:37:38	[14]Chaosvex	For being stingy fuckers
2015-09-07 08:37:47	Paprikachu	kinda silly though that they only put 16 lanes into their high end processors.
2015-09-07 08:38:02	ocZio	well
2015-09-07 08:38:05	Paprikachu	xeons have 40
2015-09-07 08:38:08	ocZio	the 4930 as 40..
2015-09-07 08:38:09	[14]Chaosvex	Yes well
2015-09-07 08:38:17	[14]Chaosvex	People have been bitching at Intel about this problem for years
2015-09-07 08:38:21	TinoDidriksen	Discrete sound card? Haven't bothered with that since forever...
2015-09-07 08:38:38	Paprikachu	TinoDidriksen: even without one, pcie ssd.

2015-09-07 08:39:07	[14]Chaosvex	Yes

2015-09-07 08:39:46	TinoDidriksen	You can blame Creative for that.
2015-09-07 08:39:52	[14]Chaosvex	+ Microsoft
2015-09-07 08:40:00	Paprikachu	my sound card is better :)
2015-09-07 08:40:12	TinoDidriksen	Creative killed a lot of promising audio tech from competing companies.
2015-09-07 08:40:17	[14]Chaosvex	This is very true

2015-09-07 08:59:15	Paprikachu	or shitty headphones
2015-09-07 08:59:22	Paprikachu	it's such a difference :S
2015-09-07 09:00:07	Paprikachu	also, mp3 is notably worse, even 320kbps
2015-09-07 09:02:26	Paprikachu	[14]Chaosvex: league of legions?
2015-09-07 09:09:20	TinoDidriksen	You cannot hear the difference between FLAC and a 320 Kbps MP3 made from that FLAC.
2015-09-07 09:09:26	Paprikachu	yes you can
2015-09-07 09:09:41	Paprikachu	my friend and i made a program to test it
2015-09-07 09:09:49	Paprikachu	it would randomly play either the mp3 or the flac
2015-09-07 09:10:00	Paprikachu	and you'd have to guess if it was the mp3 or the flac
2015-09-07 09:10:11	[14]Chaosvex	TinoDidriksen, wrong
2015-09-07 09:10:21	[14]Chaosvex	It does depend on the genre and frequencies though
2015-09-07 09:10:23	Paprikachu	i was able to pick the correct wrong in 11 out of 12 cases.
2015-09-07 09:10:28	Paprikachu	*correct one
2015-09-07 09:10:28	Paprikachu	lmao
2015-09-07 09:10:57	Elles`w	so the program was called Paprikachu's ears?
2015-09-07 09:11:09	Paprikachu	Elles`w: what? :D
2015-09-07 09:11:26	[14]Chaosvex	320kbps MP3 goes completely flat after 12khz, or perhaps 16
2015-09-07 09:11:52	Paprikachu	the program had a display that would display the guesses and a hash calculated from the previous guesses
2015-09-07 09:11:59	Paprikachu	so my friend could verify that i didnt cheat
2015-09-07 09:12:18	Paprikachu	it was legit :P
2015-09-07 09:12:22	[14]Chaosvex	You don't even need good speakers to hear the difference in some cases
2015-09-07 09:12:33	[14]Chaosvex	Or good headphones
2015-09-07 09:12:42	[14]Chaosvex	With some songs, it's just obvious

2015-09-07 09:13:21	Paprikachu	obviously not downloaded from youtube, but converted from a flac.
2015-09-07 09:13:47	[14]Chaosvex	That's the kind of song where it's going to be fairly easy to tell the difference
2015-09-07 09:14:01	Paprikachu	we tested another one too, which i forgot. i was also able to tell.

2015-09-07 09:14:08	[14]Chaosvex	The 320kbps will sound kind of muddy/flat compared to the FLAC
2015-09-07 09:14:13	Paprikachu	yeah
2015-09-07 09:14:20	Paprikachu	it wasn't *that* bad actually
2015-09-07 09:14:29	Paprikachu	but noticable if you listen carefully.
2015-09-07 09:14:30	[14]Chaosvex	320kbps isn't exactly bad
2015-09-07 09:14:34	[14]Chaosvex	But you can still tell the difference
2015-09-07 09:15:13	[14]Chaosvex	I wonder why MP3 stops at 320kbps
2015-09-07 09:15:21	[14]Chaosvex	Why can't they have say, 600kbps MP3?
2015-09-07 09:15:23	 *	[14]Chaosvex shrugs.
2015-09-07 09:15:37	Paprikachu	because it would be too easy.
2015-09-07 09:15:51	[14]Chaosvex	Then they could stop chopping frequencies out and tada
2015-09-07 09:15:57	[14]Chaosvex	To an extent, anyway
2015-09-07 09:16:04	Paprikachu	flac ftw
2015-09-07 09:16:28	[14]Chaosvex	Open a FLAC and a 320kbps MP3 in a frequency analyser
2015-09-07 09:16:32	[14]Chaosvex	The difference will be obvious
2015-09-07 09:17:36	Paprikachu	[14]Chaosvex: do you have any dubstep?
2015-09-07 09:17:59	Paprikachu	im looking for a flac of a specific song, but cant find it ):
2015-09-07 09:19:05	TinoDidriksen	It stops at 320 because that's what the standard was written to support, and nobody is developing MP3 further.
2015-09-07 09:19:44	[14]Chaosvex	Paprikachu, only a handful of files
2015-09-07 09:19:45	Paprikachu	sounds like a promising, evolving, solid, future proof standard.
2015-09-07 09:19:50	[14]Chaosvex	TinoDidriksen, well, yes :D
2015-09-07 09:19:59	[14]Chaosvex	The question is why the standard stopped there though
2015-09-07 09:20:04	[14]Chaosvex	Perhaps some kind of listening test
2015-09-07 09:20:17	Paprikachu	probably because they couldn't hear the difference
2015-09-07 09:20:23	[14]Chaosvex	Probably
2015-09-07 09:20:33	Paprikachu	"we cant hear any difference beyond that, hence nobody is going to!"
2015-09-07 09:20:38	[14]Chaosvex	"Sounds the same on my Beats By Dre. Finalise the standard."

2015-09-07 09:22:21	[14]Chaosvex	Let me guess
2015-09-07 09:22:28	TinoDidriksen	I'd assume 320 because that's what common hardware at the time could realistically handle.
2015-09-07 09:22:36	[14]Chaosvex	You like that 'warm analogue sound'?
2015-09-07 09:23:23	[14]Chaosvex	I wonder if there's anything stopping you from taking an open source MP3 encoder and just rejigging it a bit to produce higher bitrates
2015-09-07 09:23:31	[14]Chaosvex	Or whether the format actually limits it to 320kbps somehow
2015-09-07 09:23:36	[14]Chaosvex	Which would be silly but you never know
2015-09-07 09:24:08	[14]Chaosvex	I'm too lazy to go read the spec
2015-09-07 09:24:11	Ensifeurm	but is there any practical difference.
2015-09-07 09:24:27	TinoDidriksen	LAME can encode at higher than 320.
2015-09-07 09:24:36	Ensifeurm	just use flac or ogg already
2015-09-07 09:24:39	TinoDidriksen	LAME --freeformat
2015-09-07 09:24:39	[14]Chaosvex	Hm, really? Interesting.
2015-09-07 09:24:49	TinoDidriksen	"however few MP3 players can play those files."
2015-09-07 09:24:49	[14]Chaosvex	I've used LAME before but only through other tools, I believe
2015-09-07 09:24:53	[14]Chaosvex	None of them made that option available
2015-09-07 09:24:55	[14]Chaosvex	Interesting though

2015-09-07 09:28:01	epyx	what is more preferable? doing it like this http://pastebin.com/ULnYnP6J or having as much as possible in the constructor initializer list (it's called that ... right?)?

2015-09-07 09:54:49	Paprikachu	int f() { return NULL; }
2015-09-07 09:54:51	Paprikachu	there you go!
2015-09-07 09:54:53	epyx	if I recall correctly in Java you would be able to set Obj A = NULL
2015-09-07 09:55:19	Ensifeurm	nullptr
2015-09-07 09:55:22	Paprikachu	java doesn't let you construct objects in-place, everything is a reference.
2015-09-07 09:55:34	Ensifeurm	java has value types tho
2015-09-07 09:55:44	Paprikachu	not really.
2015-09-07 09:55:46	epyx	I rarely use pointers
2015-09-07 09:55:59	epyx	for instance I have a struct Collision which has a point of intersection
2015-09-07 09:56:23	epyx	in rare cases this point is not set because of floating point errors (ie when the intersection is really really small)
2015-09-07 09:56:49	Paprikachu	use fixed point

2015-09-07 10:18:03	[14]Chaosvex	Complete mismatch and it wasn't a C++ job as it was billed
2015-09-07 10:18:57	[14]Chaosvex	Yeah, when the only copy of the compiler is on a CD somewhere in France, it's probably better to run
2015-09-07 10:18:58	Ensifeurm	[14]Chaosvex: such a weak performance

2015-09-07 10:19:40	[14]Chaosvex	How come?
2015-09-07 10:19:41	Ensifeurm	but i was 14yo at the time tho
2015-09-07 10:19:47	Ensifeurm	it was... hard
2015-09-07 10:20:02	[14]Chaosvex	When the other dev doesn't bother responding to the email asking him for a list of software I'd need, instead bypassing the email and saying that I don't need to be able to compile anything anyway, run
2015-09-07 10:20:22	Ensifeurm	heh
2015-09-07 10:20:30	[14]Chaosvex	He literally ignored the email I was CCd into
2015-09-07 10:20:56	[14]Chaosvex	Then went to Skype with the guy that sent so I wouldn't see it and told him I didn't need to touch the code
2015-09-07 10:20:58	Paprikachu	french people x)
2015-09-07 10:21:09	[14]Chaosvex	*sent it
2015-09-07 10:21:16	TheSchaf	so how can you code without seeing the code
2015-09-07 10:21:28	[14]Chaosvex	TheSchaf, I looked at a ~month old backup of some of it
2015-09-07 10:21:37	[14]Chaosvex	There was no version control, just occasional folder copy/pastes
2015-09-07 10:21:46	[14]Chaosvex	Some of code was missing entirely
2015-09-07 10:22:01	TheSchaf	:D
2015-09-07 10:22:15	Paprikachu	i wouldve probably stayed
2015-09-07 10:22:24	Paprikachu	nothing to do, but getting paid!
2015-09-07 10:22:24	TheSchaf	for me it works great this time
2015-09-07 10:22:34	[14]Chaosvex	Paprikachu, having nothing to do is less fun than it sounds
2015-09-07 10:22:37	TheSchaf	i think this time it will not take me 2-3 weeks to understand what i am supposed to do
2015-09-07 10:22:42	Paprikachu	shoulda asked if you can do nothing from home
2015-09-07 10:22:48	Paprikachu	since that other guy is also remote
2015-09-07 10:22:49	[14]Chaosvex	Well, that annoyed me too
2015-09-07 10:22:54	[14]Chaosvex	Everybody else left at 1:30 on Friday
2015-09-07 10:22:55	TheSchaf	i have a pretty clear picture after a week now
2015-09-07 10:23:00	[14]Chaosvex	I was stuck there until 5pm for no reason
2015-09-07 10:23:04	Paprikachu	:)
2015-09-07 10:24:08	Paprikachu	shoulda asked for remote work!
2015-09-07 10:24:23	Paprikachu	remotely doing nothing :)
2015-09-07 10:24:42	Paprikachu	you can even time log that stuff
2015-09-07 10:24:49	[14]Chaosvex	:D
2015-09-07 10:25:07	Paprikachu	"look boss, i did nothing from 8 am to 12 pm, then again from 1 pm to 6 pm"
2015-09-07 10:25:24	Paprikachu	"i think that's called working overtime"
2015-09-07 10:25:25	[14]Chaosvex	I figured, life is too short to put up with shit
2015-09-07 10:25:56	Paprikachu	heh
2015-09-07 10:26:14	Paprikachu	what did you do anyways
2015-09-07 10:26:17	Paprikachu	since you couldnt code
2015-09-07 10:26:27	Paprikachu	was there anything at all?

2015-09-07 13:03:37	Codex_	sdl_mixer
2015-09-07 13:04:46	Codex_	but I want to control the data structures I use, so gameapi needs to represent the required data structures
2015-09-07 13:05:09	Paprikachu	what does that mean?
2015-09-07 13:05:20	BeatrixKiddo	Is music represented in gameapi as struct M?
2015-09-07 13:05:43	Codex_	beatrix: more like types SM, WAV, TRK, TBUF
2015-09-07 13:06:07	Paprikachu	and what do those stand for
2015-09-07 13:06:21	BeatrixKiddo	SM = ShitMusic
2015-09-07 13:06:31	BeatrixKiddo	WAV = Where's Anus Valley
2015-09-07 13:06:38	Codex_	SM = samples, WAV = samples in memory, TRK =tracker, TBUF = tracker in memory
2015-09-07 13:06:40	BeatrixKiddo	TRK = Totally Really Krap
2015-09-07 13:06:47	BeatrixKiddo	Damn, I was way off.
2015-09-07 13:07:09	BeatrixKiddo	None of those names are intuitive.
2015-09-07 13:08:07	Codex_	they don't need to be intuitivve
2015-09-07 13:08:23	Codex_	since that part is handled by something else
2015-09-07 13:09:03	Codex_	if you do TRK t = ev.tracker_api.empty(1,200); then it's pretty clear that TRK means tracker
2015-09-07 13:09:36	BeatrixKiddo	That's terrible reasoning.
2015-09-07 13:10:02	BeatrixKiddo	It relies on a context that may or may not be readily available.
2015-09-07 13:10:18	Codex_	the word tracker will be in every line of code
2015-09-07 13:10:34	Codex_	it doesnt need to be repeated any more than it is now
2015-09-07 13:11:12	Codex_	can you see that repeating it many times might be bad?
2015-09-07 13:11:30	Paprikachu	that's why we have auto
2015-09-07 13:11:35	BeatrixKiddo	^
2015-09-07 13:12:01	Codex_	you can still use auto if you want
2015-09-07 13:12:47	Paprikachu	right, so why give it an unreadable name?

2015-09-07 13:15:49	BeatrixKiddo	Goddamnit.
2015-09-07 13:16:15	BeatrixKiddo	Today I learned that names don't need to be intuitive when programming.
2015-09-07 13:16:41	BeatrixKiddo	Because names can be repeated 10,000 times and therefore need to be counter-intuitive to save time typing.
2015-09-07 13:17:09	BeatrixKiddo	Now I have 10,000 instances of a named object that isn't readily obvious what exactly it is
2015-09-07 13:17:18	BeatrixKiddo	That's what you call efficiency.
2015-09-07 13:17:19	Codex_	beatrix: if your code works differently from everyone elses code, it also needs to look different
2015-09-07 13:17:34	BeatrixKiddo	My code works fine and looks fine.
2015-09-07 13:17:36	Codex_	that's why I don't follow other people's advice
2015-09-07 13:17:45	TheSchaf	:D
2015-09-07 13:17:47	BeatrixKiddo	I follow advice of those who are smarter and wiser than me.
2015-09-07 13:18:03	BeatrixKiddo	It's how I avoid looking a fool 99% of the time.
2015-09-07 13:18:24	Codex_	I know better than to follow random people on irc
2015-09-07 13:18:32	BeatrixKiddo	I'm not random.
2015-09-07 13:18:46	Codex_	what makes you special?
2015-09-07 13:18:50	Paprikachu	Codex_: you really haven't thought your naming convention through.
2015-09-07 13:18:59	BeatrixKiddo	Nothing makes me special.
2015-09-07 13:19:03	[14]Chaosvex	The other 1% of the time, BeatrixKiddo has his pants on the ground
2015-09-07 13:19:06	Codex_	pap: it's better designed than you think
2015-09-07 13:19:07	Paprikachu	if you're going to argue that names are irrelevant, use one-letter names.
2015-09-07 13:19:10	[14]Chaosvex	Looking like a fool with his pants on the ground
2015-09-07 13:19:18	BeatrixKiddo	hat turned sideways looking like a fool with my pants on the ground
2015-09-07 13:20:05	BeatrixKiddo	Codex_: If 100% of the people who've seen gameapi are telling you it's straight garbage, there's probably a reason for that.
2015-09-07 13:20:12	[14]Chaosvex	"use one-letter names."
2015-09-07 13:20:16	[14]Chaosvex	What do you think 'e' is?
2015-09-07 13:20:27	BeatrixKiddo	e is an instance of E.
2015-09-07 13:20:28	Paprikachu	but he's not consistent on that.
2015-09-07 13:20:36	Codex_	beatrix: they don't have valid issues -- their only issue is that it doesnt look like OO code that they love
2015-09-07 13:20:50	Codex_	beatrix: but it cannot look like OO code, since I'm using something different
2015-09-07 13:21:07	[14]Chaosvex	Next level shit
2015-09-07 13:21:08	BeatrixKiddo	It doesn't even look like functional code.
2015-09-07 13:21:34	Codex_	beatrix: it looks pretty much the same as Haskell's standard library

2015-09-07 13:46:25	BeatrixKiddo	I dunno. I only had to write that once and now I have an instance for whatever I need and don't need to write BM or P or what-the-fuck-ever.
2015-09-07 13:46:47	BeatrixKiddo	I just saved myself a shitload of money by switching to templates.

2015-09-07 13:49:20	BeatrixKiddo	I mean, if this isn't a perfect opportunity to use a template, then when is there a proper time to use a template?
2015-09-07 13:50:05	Codex_	the api needs to be simple enough for newbies. I can't expect templates to be known.
2015-09-07 13:50:37	Codex_	also simpler = cleaner api
2015-09-07 13:50:51	Codex_	adding all kinds of complex templates is only going to make it worse

2015-09-07 13:55:05	BeatrixKiddo	So, in functional programming, it doesn't matter what I name my types or variables as long as the functions have meaningful names.
2015-09-07 13:55:47	Codex_	the handle names need to be somehow connected to the concept being used.
2015-09-07 13:56:01	Codex_	like BM type is clearly connected to bitmap
2015-09-07 13:56:17	BeatrixKiddo	"Clearly" by what standard?
2015-09-07 13:56:45	BeatrixKiddo	What is the thought process you use when determining names?
2015-09-07 13:58:14	Codex_	I decide the api name first, for example BitmapApi. Then I decide the variable name in everyapi, for example bitmap_api. Then BM type follows that naming. Then functions have names that describe what is being done to the BM type, i.e. the mappings.
2015-09-07 13:58:58	Codex_	the thing is that BM type is completely opaque
2015-09-07 13:59:10	Codex_	there is no member functions or variables inside BM type.

2015-09-07 14:20:27	Codex_	it did require some clever design inside gameapi

2015-09-07 14:22:24	BeatrixKiddo	Codex_: Give me an example of "clever" design.
2015-09-07 14:22:50	Codex_	the main design of gameapi's data structures is that it defers the memory allocation point to prepare() function. Thus gameapi data structures take almost no memory at all, but it'll only be allocated once opengl wants it in a memory buffer
2015-09-07 14:24:15	Codex_	the pattern looks like this: BM bm = ev.bitmap_api.empty(100,100); ev.sprite_api.preparesprite(bm); while(1) { ... ev.sprite_api.rendersprite(bm,10,10); }
2015-09-07 14:24:30	Codex_	the prepare() is handled before main loop starts

2015-09-07 14:29:18	Codex_	the main behaviour of the gameapi is done without the memory being allocated
2015-09-07 14:29:53	BD-Calvin	where "the memory" refers specifically to gpu resources.. cause you use a shitton of intermediate structures allocated on the heap
2015-09-07 14:30:04	BD-Calvin	especially if you start composing functions, then memory usage shoots up through the roof

2015-09-07 14:42:41	BeatrixKiddo	Because now that I know it's a handle and not a bitmap, I can now expect it to do handle stuff and not bitmap stuff.

2015-09-07 15:03:41	BeatrixKiddo	Thanks for the laugh, gray1, I needed that. You were depressing me for a moment there.
2015-09-07 15:03:44	gray1	unpleasant people. What's the point...
2015-09-07 15:04:10	gray1	BeatrixKiddo mr witty i see you are
2015-09-07 15:04:35	Codex_	gray1: ##opengl has some pretty pleasant people
2015-09-07 15:04:36	BeatrixKiddo	Yeah, I'm fucking hilarious.
2015-09-07 15:04:54	Codex_	gray1: they're more used to people showing their products
2015-09-07 15:08:24	Codex_	this is the code required to design and play a song: http://codepad.org/Iv4YEn9J
2015-09-07 15:09:16	Codex_	this small piece of code basically does everything that a modern sound tracker can do.
2015-09-07 15:09:51	BeatrixKiddo	I have to ask the "horrible" "unconstructive" question: how is that not shit?

2015-09-07 15:11:07	BeatrixKiddo	What benefit does that yield me?
2015-09-07 15:11:20	Codex_	if you do something like : load("foo.mod"), the data wont be available in the code.
2015-09-07 15:11:26	gray1	BeatrixKiddo: do you talk to all people in life like this?
2015-09-07 15:11:35	gray1	i'm surprised you've gotten this far
2015-09-07 15:11:43	BeatrixKiddo	gray1: Thanks.
2015-09-07 15:12:02	BeatrixKiddo	gray1: Is it your day off, too?
2015-09-07 15:12:28	BeatrixKiddo	gray1: We're essentially doing the same thing, bashing someone else for their apparent idiocy.
2015-09-07 15:12:33	gray1	that's none of your business. But if you're spending your day off doing this then you really don't have much
