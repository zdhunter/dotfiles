2015-01-20 22:42:54	thiago	Tec: so let's discount QtQuick2ApplicationViewer
2015-01-20 22:43:06	thiago	Tec: QDeclarativeEngine, since it is a "QDeclarative" class, is about Qt Quick 1
2015-01-20 22:43:21	thiago	so that leaves only two options: QQmlEngine and QQmlApplicationEngine
2015-01-20 22:43:35	thiago	the latter is a wrapper on the former and adds a few extra convenience, that's all

2015-01-20 22:46:46	Tec	Rawks: code for your target.  Things don't always work
2015-01-20 22:47:14	thiago	Tec: it used to be documented in the trolltech.com website
2015-01-20 22:47:21	rawks	a simple GUI should be able to run on at least windows and unix
2015-01-20 22:47:22	thiago	All Qt classes start with Q + capital letter
2015-01-20 22:47:25	thiago	no exception
2015-01-20 22:47:33	rawks	however im not sure about playback
2015-01-20 22:47:37	chriadam	Tec: so, the Qxt class library has classes which start with Qxt (eg, QxtSerialPort etc).  That's how you know it's a non-standard extension library for Qt.  All Qt classes start with Q only (eg, QQmlEngine etc)
2015-01-20 22:47:39	Tec	I think you just dated yourself  ;-)
2015-01-20 22:48:01	thiago	there was even a way to register your lowercase suffix there
2015-01-20 22:48:09	chriadam	yeah, it's still listed on the wiki somewhere
2015-01-20 22:48:12	chriadam	I believe
2015-01-20 22:48:22	thiago	Qxt, Qext
2015-01-20 22:48:29	thiago	what was that one for the graph plotter?
2015-01-20 22:48:51	Tec	So … QQmlApplicationEngine is 'real?'
2015-01-20 22:49:14	chriadam	thiago: Qwt?
2015-01-20 22:49:19	thiago	yes, it's part of the QtQml library
2015-01-20 22:49:20	thiago	chriadam: right
2015-01-20 22:49:27	chriadam	Tec: yes, but it's just a convenience wrapper really
2015-01-20 22:49:32	Tec	and     QtQuick2ApplicationViewer viewer; isnt'?
2015-01-20 22:49:46	thiago	Tec: I'm not saying it doesn't exist. I'm saying it's not part of Qt
2015-01-20 22:49:55	thiago	Tec: you create classes in your application, right?

2015-01-20 22:50:22	Tec	sorry, just going wow, there are -years- of bad docs out there
2015-01-20 22:50:32	chriadam	I think that QtQuick2ApplicationViewer might be something which QtCreator uses as a template for QtQuick apps - but don't quote me, I might be wrong.
2015-01-20 22:50:40	thiago	I think so too
2015-01-20 22:50:50	thiago	it's a class that Qt Creator inserts in your application, coming from a template
2015-01-20 22:50:55	Tec	none of which have that rule. I've been Qt 3 years or so myself.  Never seen that as a rule.
2015-01-20 22:51:08	Tec	Good rule, probably should be doc'd
2015-01-20 22:51:08	thiago	Qt classes are well-named
2015-01-20 22:51:13	thiago	all the QML classes are QQml

2015-01-20 22:52:50	Tec	-which-  Qt owner was this the story for?
2015-01-20 22:53:02	thiago	I don't know why you'd look at youtube for this
2015-01-20 22:53:09	thiago	just look at the class list
2015-01-20 22:53:24	chriadam	what do you mean?  it mainly applies to people who write extension libraries.  They're basically "not allowed" to use Q as their prefix, but instead must use Q<something>
2015-01-20 22:53:26	Tec	because that's where the best classes are
2015-01-20 22:53:47	thiago	http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/classes.html
2015-01-20 22:54:18	thiago	there's over a thousand classes there. None with a lowercase second letter.
2015-01-20 22:54:21	Tec	Voidrealms on Qt is better than the official channels
2015-01-20 22:54:22	chriadam	in inverted commas, obviously, as we can't really enforce anything.  But since we don't namespace our stuff (well, in the past, at least, that might be different with mobility / more recent stuff) there could be clashes.
2015-01-20 22:55:01	chriadam	actually, I'm wrong about that, we do have a Qt namespace don't we?  /ignoreme
2015-01-20 22:55:13	Tec	can I use that now?
2015-01-20 22:55:20	thiago	our namespace is "Q + capital"
2015-01-20 22:55:31	Tec	 /ignoreme
2015-01-20 22:55:43	chriadam	right.

2015-01-20 22:58:28	thiago	I don't know where we've written this down
2015-01-20 22:59:05	Tec	Wow.  That doesn't make it super easy for me to convince them how cool it is

2015-01-20 23:04:06	Tec	if everything new and/or better is being proprietary, then I guess I don't know what 'great job' is

2015-01-20 23:17:58	jeromelanteri	the technic who consist to inherit a class instead of add some conditons inside for double use, is better (for sure) and more oriented object practice.
2015-01-20 23:18:25	jeromelanteri	but... i don't know... why you tell me to use condition instead of doing this ? i not understand. Could you tell me ?
2015-01-20 23:19:44	jeromelanteri	is there a raison you tell me to go by condition and not by inherit the class ?
2015-01-20 23:19:51	jeromelanteri	and what is this reason ?

2015-01-20 23:22:57	jeromelanteri	maybe i'm wrong... but for me... change the code by the way to add conditions would be difficult more and (i think) difficult after that to maintain the code. Also, long time to do it. But maybe there is some technical reason in the facts that it would be the best choice... i want to understand and know which caould be these reasons...

2015-01-20 23:26:37	jeromelanteri	the question is: why you think that use condition would be better than inherit the class ?
2015-01-20 23:26:50	jeromelanteri	luciano: pixmap.show() maybe ?
2015-01-20 23:26:59	thiago	jeromelanteri: I didn't say that you shouldn't inherit
2015-01-20 23:27:11	thiago	I said you should design first without inheriting because you were messing up the design
2015-01-20 23:27:20	thiago	you forced the inheriting before getting the design right first
2015-01-20 23:27:20	jeromelanteri	but you tell me to choose the condition way...
2015-01-20 23:27:57	jeromelanteri	thiago: but for me, the design consist only by made method protected inste
2015-01-20 23:28:11	jeromelanteri	instead of private, and use virtual and override...
2015-01-20 23:28:18	thiago	jeromelanteri: that's a valid design pattern
2015-01-20 23:28:21	luciano	jeromelanteri,  'class QPixmap' has no member named 'show  pixmap.show();
2015-01-20 23:28:24	jeromelanteri	re-use the same struct datas...
2015-01-20 23:28:31	thiago	there's nothing wrong with that
2015-01-20 23:28:37	thiago	there was something wrong with your code
2015-01-20 23:28:44	thiago	I advised you make it work first, so you could fix the code
2015-01-20 23:28:53	thiago	once you had that right, you could design the inheritance
2015-01-20 23:29:31	jeromelanteri	thiago: yes... because i'm not a dev and learn alone (and by your help), i constrcut my code and make it grow in the same time...
2015-01-20 23:29:59	jeromelanteri	so i try and change one... and do the same for all other whoi need the same design patern.
2015-01-20 23:31:20	jeromelanteri	so, ok... i understand i think. You tell me that maybe because you thank that it would be too complicate or difficult for me to learn more about C++ quickly (or something like that). And then... condition ccoudl be sure a solution were i no need to learn more.
2015-01-20 23:31:50	jeromelanteri	so ok, happy to read that inherit class could be a good choice.
2015-01-20 23:32:05	jeromelanteri	i will do it for all other.
2015-01-20 23:32:12	jeromelanteri	thanks
2015-01-20 23:32:22	thiago	I suggested a way that I expected would help you design the code right
