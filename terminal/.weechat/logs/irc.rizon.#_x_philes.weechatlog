2015-09-10 00:44:06	MothDan	does anyone else get random calls from weird numbers on their phone?
2015-09-10 00:44:10	MothDan	just once in a great while
2015-09-10 00:44:17	oldboy	i always answer them
2015-09-10 00:44:28	MothDan	do they ever just hang up on you?
2015-09-10 00:44:44	MothDan	i know it's not paranormal it's usually phishers, autodialers, etc
2015-09-10 00:44:45	Vehryn	I get that sometimes.
2015-09-10 00:44:47	tink	what's weird about the number? i get calls from random people but the numbers seem normal and when i look them up it's usually scams or telemarketers
2015-09-10 00:44:47	oldboy	yes
2015-09-10 00:44:48	SpoopsMcGee	I answer them with talking about my penis.
2015-09-10 00:44:51	MothDan	but it's gotten bad over the past few years
2015-09-10 00:44:56	Vehryn	What tink said.
2015-09-10 00:44:59	oldboy	i used to prank back some fucker that kept calling me and shit
2015-09-10 00:45:07	oldboy	i cant quite remember what happened 
2015-09-10 00:45:16	tink	do you have your number connected to facebook or google account, just for my curiosity?
2015-09-10 00:45:39	oldboy	he kept leaving voicemails so i kept calling, hanging up if he answered, until he finally didnt answer then i would leave a voicemail
2015-09-10 00:45:45	Vehryn	I also kept getting calls trying to sell me old-people-medical-safety stuff.
2015-09-10 00:45:47	MothDan	Nope but I did get voicemail for someone else once it's probably that
2015-09-10 00:46:02	Vehryn	After the third one I went through the hassle of connecting to a human to scream at them for their audacity.
2015-09-10 00:46:03	MothDan	and that person has bumbled their number into the hands of all kinds of people
2015-09-10 00:46:08	SpoopsMcGee	I also like to act like I'm 70
2015-09-10 00:46:09	MothDan	which is actually my number now
2015-09-10 00:46:12	SpoopsMcGee	and scream "WHAT?!"
2015-09-10 00:46:35	oldboy	i used to get random ass shit when i had a trackfone 
2015-09-10 00:46:41	Vehryn	I am not nice to telemarketers.
2015-09-10 00:46:43	oldboy	guess the numbers get recycled tons
2015-09-10 00:46:49	tink	yeah some girl gave my number to an employment agency a month ago and i got several calls before they gave up
2015-09-10 00:47:08	tink	or the people there wrote it down wrong i guess

2015-09-10 00:48:04	MothDan	good job tink now unemployment is way up

2015-09-10 00:49:08	MothDan	who else can I shame...
2015-09-10 00:49:38	tink	there's always shaming yourself
2015-09-10 00:49:41	Vehryn	Not being an expert on the lifecycle and anatomy of the common grue, I can only hope that a bigger grue eats you.
2015-09-10 00:49:46	MothDan	well I'm always doing that
2015-09-10 00:49:52	MothDan	that's why I need to shame you
2015-09-10 00:50:37	Vehryn	MothDan, I can't cause anyone to kill themselves. I can only be me.
2015-09-10 00:50:40	MothDan	best part is I'm the one who brought it up hehe
2015-09-10 00:50:52	MothDan	true
2015-09-10 00:51:13	MothDan	I was telling medamaude I think earlier how I was a customer service rep on the phone
2015-09-10 00:51:22	SpoopsMcGee	Too busying invading to kill self.
2015-09-10 00:51:24	MothDan	instead of a telemarketer who makes calls they receive calls
2015-09-10 00:51:39	MothDan	get far less hate from the customer
2015-09-10 00:52:10	Vehryn	My rage is reserved for the ones who call me.
2015-09-10 00:53:18	MothDan	when did everyone start talking about grues?

2015-09-10 00:56:52	MothDan	it's funny because southpark took a lot of heat for the ginger thing but the redheaded stepchild saying is ancient
2015-09-10 00:57:01	MothDan	poor reds

2015-09-10 01:03:21	MothDan	even the simplest game was like a magical object back then
2015-09-10 01:03:27	Vehryn	Do you think Huxley ever actually thought the government would issue people LSD to relax them from the constant work environment?
2015-09-10 01:03:44	MothDan	not that i was really part of it i was just a typical late 80s baby NES / SNES scrub
2015-09-10 01:03:56	MothDan	but old PC gaming is pretty fascinating, really old as in the big floppy drive days
2015-09-10 01:04:15	MothDan	Huxley clearly knew serotonin reuptake inhibitors would be a thing
2015-09-10 01:04:40	MothDan	with soma, some people think Pot has become soma but it doesn't have all the same traits necessarily
2015-09-10 01:05:57	Vehryn	I agree, marijuana's not a good fit for soma.

2015-09-10 01:07:07	MothDan	the LSD spider shows incredible attention to detail
2015-09-10 01:07:07	SpoopsMcGee	Soma is my shit.
2015-09-10 01:07:08	MothDan	too much
2015-09-10 01:07:43	Vehryn	I like the spastic nature of the caffeine spider.
2015-09-10 01:07:55	SpoopsMcGee	The comparison of Soma to pot is invalid for a few reasons, one of the main ones being that you can legitimately overdose on soma.
2015-09-10 01:08:04	MothDan	it's very honest, caffeine definitely makes people more scatter brained but gives more energy
2015-09-10 01:08:08	SpoopsMcGee	Where as pot, you'll pass out before you get near ODing.
2015-09-10 01:08:20	MothDan	yep true
2015-09-10 01:08:48	MothDan	LSD is an amphetamine which like meth causes some people to obsess over small details like that spider
2015-09-10 01:08:59	MothDan	the spider was trying to create an impossibly perfect web
2015-09-10 01:09:07	Vehryn	Kind of wish I hadn't loaned my copy of BNW to an old coworker five years ago. Dude probably never read it, anyway.
2015-09-10 01:09:38	SpoopsMcGee	I convinced my Senior year English teacher to assign it
2015-09-10 01:09:49	SpoopsMcGee	And I still have my copy somewhere.
2015-09-10 01:10:09	medamaude	lsd is not an amphetamine though, is it?
2015-09-10 01:10:21	MothDan	it is, that's why they gave it to soldiers
2015-09-10 01:10:39	medamaude	when did they give lsd to soldiers?
2015-09-10 01:10:47	MothDan	it's pretty funny how effective it is, you can run for 20 miles if you didn't get caught up looking at the sky and flowers
2015-09-10 01:11:06	MothDan	the nazis in ww2
2015-09-10 01:11:17	MothDan	they had other discoveries of course like meth, which adolf took
2015-09-10 01:11:22	MothDan	and all soldiers, really
2015-09-10 01:11:30	SpoopsMcGee	Remember kids, Heroin was suppose to replace morphine and treat morphine addiction. hue
2015-09-10 01:11:53	MothDan	really? eww
2015-09-10 01:12:19	SpoopsMcGee	Yeah. Totally worked, righT?
2015-09-10 01:12:57	tink	well now they give other drugs to opiate addicts to taper them down and i've seen people addicted to those on intervention
2015-09-10 01:14:00	MothDan	hmm yeah there are some that are like 50x stronger than morphine right?
2015-09-10 01:14:03	tink	and i never knew that lsd was an amphetamine either, you sure about that?
2015-09-10 01:14:10	MothDan	oh yeah
2015-09-10 01:14:25	medamaude	yeah I'm not finding any evidence of that, can you please sauce us?
2015-09-10 01:14:26	Vehryn	I'm gonna' need a source on that.
2015-09-10 01:15:31	MothDan	Partial agonist effects at 5HT2A receptors are implicated in the psychedelic actions of LSD and related hallucinogens. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly called ecstasy, is an amphetamine derivative
2015-09-10 01:15:36	MothDan	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide
2015-09-10 01:15:43	MothDan	oh
2015-09-10 01:15:51	MothDan	it was a biproduct of amphetamine research nvm
2015-09-10 01:16:04	MothDan	so we got meth, ecstasy and LSD all from the same efforts really
2015-09-10 01:16:27	MothDan	german efficiency
2015-09-10 01:16:32	SpoopsMcGee	Delicious.
2015-09-10 01:19:01	tink	Three days later, on April 19, 1943, Hofmann intentionally ingested 250 micrograms of LSD. This day is now known as "Bicycle Day," because after starting to feel the effects of the drug he rode home on a bike, and that became the first intentional acid trip
2015-09-10 01:19:12	MothDan	lol
2015-09-10 01:19:59	MothDan	I'm pretty sure LSD as it is now is a mind control drug
2015-09-10 01:20:20	MothDan	I dosed with thousands of other hippies at the rainbow gathering in wyoming a few years back
2015-09-10 01:20:45	MothDan	if you're on it, and you remove yourself from everyone else, you can still feel the party
2015-09-10 01:20:47	<	bastard (~bastard@mermaids.or.bust) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2015-09-10 01:21:23	MothDan	as if everyone who gets the same batch gets swallowed by the same mind
2015-09-10 01:21:41	MothDan	this lead me to research woodstock and other events where acid is commonly used on large groups of people
2015-09-10 01:21:55	MothDan	and then tot he origins of lsd as a mind control drug and military researched thing etc.
2015-09-10 01:21:56	MothDan	wild stuff
2015-09-10 01:22:40	MothDan	nothing that wasn't already done to death in the 60s thouh
2015-09-10 01:23:35	tink	i've never done any hallucinogens. i feel like it would be too intense for me but i've been curious for a long time.
2015-09-10 01:24:31	Vehryn	I've read some things that have made me curious about DMT, but never actually tried it.
2015-09-10 01:24:36	MothDan	if salvia is legal in your state you might be happy with that
2015-09-10 01:24:55	MothDan	salvia is the only legal DMT equivalent, and only real legal psychedelic
2015-09-10 01:25:13	MothDan	it's being slowly taken away though, we were definitely never meant to get our hands on it like we have in the past decade
2015-09-10 01:25:19	MothDan	which is why they had miley cyrus pull her stunt
2015-09-10 01:25:36	MothDan	and it's since been getting pulled from one state after another
2015-09-10 01:26:04	tink	what happened with miley?
2015-09-10 01:26:08	SpoopsMcGee	Still haven't had hallucinogens, curiousy but not curious enough.
2015-09-10 01:26:27	Vehryn	^
2015-09-10 01:26:56	MothDan	miley did salvia and babbled about it like it was a big deal and then they shamed her on the news and tv for a couple weeks over it
2015-09-10 01:27:05	MothDan	to send the message "only doofy weirdos do salvia"
2015-09-10 01:27:07	SpoopsMcGee	Well the thing is...
2015-09-10 01:27:12	SpoopsMcGee	Miley is a cunt. Nothing more to it.
2015-09-10 01:27:19	MothDan	this was during the same time that people tripping on salvia was becoming a youtube trend, it still kind of is
2015-09-10 01:27:46	MothDan	just trying to steer people away from it really, but it's still there
2015-09-10 01:27:48	Vehryn	Knew someone who offered to have me try shrooms. Didn't really trust the guy enough to take him up on the offer, though.
2015-09-10 01:28:37	SpoopsMcGee	Found Peyote once, didn't bother to give it a munch.
2015-09-10 01:28:53	tink	yeah, not smart to make yourself vulnerable with people you don't trust, vehryn
2015-09-10 01:29:24	MothDan	but spoops you could have had a beavis and butthead do america moment

2015-09-10 01:30:11	SpoopsMcGee	Yeah....I'll pass. I would really need the right place to trip.
2015-09-10 01:31:18	Vehryn	If there's one bit of info I'd follow from Leary, it's the notion of 'set' and 'setting' - applied to any potential trip.
2015-09-10 01:32:05	SpoopsMcGee	Don't wanna be anywhere you'll fucking kill yourself, that's for sure.
2015-09-10 01:32:28	Vehryn	Or around anyone likely to do you wrong.
2015-09-10 01:33:54	SpoopsMcGee	Most of the people I hang around are straight dudes, so at the worst someone might take shit from my wallet.
2015-09-10 01:34:14	Vehryn	At first I read that as "take a shit in my wallet."
2015-09-10 01:34:31	SpoopsMcGee	They might do that too
2015-09-10 01:38:01	MothDan	afk, possibly until i fall asleep! have a good night /x/
2015-09-10 01:40:41	SpoopsMcGee	Don't worry about the tapping at your window and shit.

2015-09-10 01:49:31	SpoopsMcGee	I honestly miss the days when I could listen to the autistic people of various boards sing. It was always funny.
2015-09-10 01:50:25	Vehryn	Did anyone ever look into the OKC-PRG cams on the previous link?
2015-09-10 01:50:31	SpoopsMcGee	Nah.
2015-09-10 01:51:23	SpoopsMcGee	Seems like a nice old spoop time
2015-09-10 01:52:31	Vehryn	There must be spotlights on outside the building or something. because there seems to be bright light shining through what looks to be a shuttered window and also some coming through the occasional doorway.
2015-09-10 01:53:14	SpoopsMcGee	Hmm...
2015-09-10 01:53:28	SpoopsMcGee	Did anyone else look at the soundcloud links I posted last night?
2015-09-10 01:53:49	Vehryn	Not that I recall.
