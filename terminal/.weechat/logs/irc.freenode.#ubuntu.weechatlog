When I tried logging back in, I was stuck at an infinite login loop on the GUI. I could, however, login to TTY. I followed a guide I found online and managed to get it to boot (there was an error with my profiles file). So  after I restored the files to my home directory and

I can press Ctrl+C to break this and use it like normal, but if I don't and let it sit there for about a minute, it will kick me back out and I have to login again.
