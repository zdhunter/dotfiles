2016-07-31 01:35:38	%DANtheBEASTman	imagine writing your form validation once, and it works both server and client side. that's why node.js is popular.
2016-07-31 01:36:46	%DANtheBEASTman	linguistically, javascript isn't a great language, but it's also not so terrible that it makes you want to kill yourself, like php
2016-07-31 01:37:03	ewhal4	just use golang
2016-07-31 01:37:08	ewhal4	you can even compile golang to js
2016-07-31 01:41:03	%DANtheBEASTman	this is true, but in the end your browser is going to spit out errors from your transpiled code, and it helps to know js in order to understand what's happening under the hood. javascript is basically the new ASM, but our tools aren't quite as capable as gcc and clang are
2016-07-31 01:41:29	ewhal4	or just wait for web asm 
2016-07-31 01:41:44	%DANtheBEASTman	v a p o r w a r e
2016-07-31 01:42:08	ewhal4	nah it has massive potential and will allow autists to use languages other than js clientside
2016-07-31 01:42:10	ewhal4	which is great
2016-07-31 01:43:47	%DANtheBEASTman	still years away from being in evergreen browsers, and then many more years before you safely use it in a "professional" environment
2016-07-31 01:43:56	ewhal4	eh
2016-07-31 01:44:17	%DANtheBEASTman	in the meantime, we're stuck with javascript, so i'm getty comfy with it

2016-07-31 02:14:35	vinny	even then webgl is still a thing, and JS is known to run as fast as C under its JIT or AoT compilers
2016-07-31 02:15:27	vinny	you're wasting your own time, and therefore money, using webasm, and nobody's going to hire someone who takes 3+ times longer just to deploy a page/webgl app lmao
