2014-04-24 19:14:24	stacktaxi	I don't know. Once everyone started staring at Lain he was pretty spooky
2014-04-24 19:14:44	lucasoutloud	I had to actually read the wikipedia page to understand lain's plot
2014-04-24 19:14:54	@I_can_FLY	I would like to goto this meetup that that hackerspace group is having.
2014-04-24 19:15:00	azk	Do it.
