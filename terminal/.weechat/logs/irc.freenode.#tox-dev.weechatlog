2014-04-15 15:44:15	Zenexer	Just because Stallman gets wet over old technology doesn't mean it's good.
2014-04-15 15:44:28	+stqism	Zenexer: And...supported. Commercially.
2014-04-15 15:44:33	+stqism	Old != bad
2014-04-15 15:44:40	Zenexer	In this case, old == bad
2014-04-15 15:44:40	+mouseym	my centos server isnt affected by heartbleed... because my openssl version is ancient

2014-04-15 15:44:57	Zenexer	alex1: Absolutely nothing.  Move along.
2014-04-15 15:45:08	alex1	stallman is jesus
2014-04-15 15:45:19	alex1	he even looks like him
2014-04-15 15:45:29	Zenexer	Right, praise the lefties and all that
2014-04-15 15:45:40	Zenexer	stqism: Canonical doesn't count as commercial?
2014-04-15 15:45:50	THE_KGB	COMMUNISM
2014-04-15 15:45:56	+stqism	Zenexer: They fully do
2014-04-15 15:45:59	+mouseym	RUSSIA STRONK
2014-04-15 15:46:11	+stqism	Zenexer: A lot of the work on the Linux kernel is a result of commercialism
2014-04-15 15:46:38	Zenexer	stqism: Good, so 3.x is commercially supported.
2014-04-15 15:46:45	Zenexer	Canonical advantage.
2014-04-15 15:47:01	+stqism	Zenexer: To be fair, Red Hat is the billion dollar company here.
2014-04-15 15:47:17	+stal[GL]	install bsd
2014-04-15 15:47:26	THE_KGB	BETTER DEAD THEN RED
2014-04-15 15:47:53	alex1	isn't red hat a jew rat hole
2014-04-15 15:48:12	+stal[GL]	racist
2014-04-15 15:48:19	Zenexer	I used to be a Red Hat fan
2014-04-15 15:48:19	+stqism	They do a ton of the work on the Linux kernel, to be fair
2014-04-15 15:48:36	Zenexer	Then all of my stuff was always buggy and out of date
2014-04-15 15:48:47	Zenexer	And Debian across the street was so much more organized
2014-04-15 15:49:03	Zenexer	And Ubuntu was even better, with patches for everything
2014-04-15 15:49:12	Zenexer	...so Ubuntu won
2014-04-15 15:49:22	+stqism	You're telling me you don't use Oracle Enterprise Linux with the unbreakable kernel?
2014-04-15 15:49:24	+mouseym	ubongo is not a centos replacement
2014-04-15 15:49:36	+stqism	Ubreakable Enterprise Kernel, rather
2014-04-15 15:49:44	+stqism	mouseym: +1, other marketshares
2014-04-15 15:50:01	+stal[GL]	linux is bloat
2014-04-15 15:50:13	+stqism	^
2014-04-15 15:50:17	+stal[GL]	bsd does not have this problem
2014-04-15 15:50:22	+stqism	That kernel takes forever to compile, shit
2014-04-15 15:50:32	Zenexer	Well, I use most of said bloat
2014-04-15 15:50:36	+stqism	XNU is actually nice to develop with

2014-04-15 15:51:14	Zenexer	I use quite a few tools that require features not available outside of Linux
2014-04-15 15:51:40	Zenexer	For example, I'm pretty sure Docker is incompatible with BSD due to lack of kernel support
2014-04-15 15:51:42	+stqism	Please don't say they came from freedesktop
2014-04-15 15:52:12	Zenexer	And if BSD doesn't have upstart, there's no way in hell that I'm switching.
2014-04-15 15:52:30	+stqism	Zenexer: If you wanted to play that game, the FreeBSD kernel has a linuxulator module, it maps Linux kernel syscalls allowing it to run native Linux binaries natively.
2014-04-15 15:52:32	Zenexer	SysV init is lame
2014-04-15 15:52:44	Zenexer	stqism: Sounds like bloat :)
2014-04-15 15:52:47	gruetzkopf	sysvinit best init
2014-04-15 15:52:59	+stal[GL]	init is bloat
2014-04-15 15:53:01	+stqism	Zenexer: Ubuntu is moving to systemd :)
2014-04-15 15:53:08	alex1	good
2014-04-15 15:53:11	Zenexer	No, Ubuntu is moving to Upstart

2014-04-15 15:54:15	Zenexer	I use Ubuntu every day
2014-04-15 15:54:20	Zenexer	Everything is upstart
2014-04-15 15:54:25	Zenexer	So...
2014-04-15 15:54:31	+stqism	Moving, they made upstrart and are dropping it in future releases for systemd
2014-04-15 15:54:38	alex1	doesn't change the fact its going to systemd
2014-04-15 15:54:38	Zenexer	Ugh
2014-04-15 15:54:51	Zenexer	Upstart was so awesome
2014-04-15 15:54:53	Zenexer	Whyyyyy
2014-04-15 15:54:58	alex1	systemd is better
2014-04-15 15:54:59	+stqism	Zenexer: Hey look, Shuttleworths personal blog stating the move http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/1316
2014-04-15 15:55:09	Zenexer	I don't even know who that is
2014-04-15 15:55:10	+stqism	Zenexer: Only Gentoo is safe on the Linux front

2014-04-15 15:55:23	+stal[GL]	launchd is the best
2014-04-15 15:55:30	zetok	perhaps Slackware too
2014-04-15 15:55:33	+stal[GL]	you can't deny it
2014-04-15 15:55:49	+stqism	He's the damn founder of Ubuntu
2014-04-15 15:55:56	+stqism	The Linus of the Ubuntus
2014-04-15 15:56:05	zetok	don't call him that
2014-04-15 15:56:13	+stqism	It's true :(
2014-04-15 15:56:18	zetok	:/
2014-04-15 15:56:27	Zenexer	It looks like they gave up, and they wanted to use upstart
2014-04-15 15:56:40	+stqism	Even Debian joined them
2014-04-15 15:56:45	Zenexer	Upstart is really slick.  It's lightweight, it's powerful, and it's easy to use
2014-04-15 15:56:46	+stqism	Only Gentoo
2014-04-15 15:56:47	zetok	Zenexer: even *buntu doesn't know what it really wants
2014-04-15 15:57:03	+stqism	upstrart on Debian was actually very nice
2014-04-15 15:57:17	Zenexer	Ugh I'm going to have to rewrite so much
2014-04-15 15:57:57	Zenexer	"systemd is a system and session manager for Linux, compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points and
2014-04-15 15:57:57	Zenexer	implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic."
2014-04-15 15:58:04	Zenexer	I have to say, that sounds convincing.
2014-04-15 15:58:10	+stqism	Systemd is going to kill Linux
2014-04-15 15:58:25	leah_twoskin	mmm, segfault
2014-04-15 15:58:27	leah_twoskin	So good.
2014-04-15 15:59:18	+stqism	Zenexer: Passing the debug kernel parameter via grub on boot floods systemd causing it to not boot. They called this a feature, later trying to fix it by changing a kernel argument. Linus blew up on them, and refused to merge any more systemd shit
2014-04-15 16:00:00	Zenexer	Haha
2014-04-15 16:00:22	+stqism	Zenexer: The free desktop folks are designing things and not fixing major bugs, expecting others to work around it. They are also working on adding dhcp
2014-04-15 16:00:22	Zenexer	Maybe Canonical sided with systemd just to fuck with Linus.
2014-04-15 16:00:41	ro	dhcp?
2014-04-15 16:00:54	Zenexer	If Canonical gets involved, I'm sure they'll give it a thorough cleanup.
2014-04-15 16:00:56	+stqism	Zenexer: It's like astonex fixing a bug in Antox by breaking core with a pull request in every other client
2014-04-15 16:01:11	Zenexer	Lost me on that one.
2014-04-15 16:01:13	+stqism	ro: It assigns IPs and queries a dhcp server
2014-04-15 16:01:34	Zenexer	Doesn't cloud-init already handle stuff like that?
2014-04-15 16:01:59	Zenexer	Canonical should just do a final fork and go off in its own direction lol
2014-04-15 16:03:03	+stqism	Zenexer: Imagine stal[GL] has an issue with poison where he used a incorrect argument in toxcore. He fixes it by switching the values around in toxcore, breaking everyone elses clients.
2014-04-15 16:03:09	+stqism	That is what systemd does.

2014-04-15 16:04:35	Zenexer	I have no idea who's doing what, etc.
2014-04-15 16:05:00	ro	a client guy broke his client and he made it work by changing the core which breaks all the other clients
2014-04-15 16:05:08	+stqism	Zenexer: It's like stal[GL] loosing a race, so he changes the rules and makes last place first.
2014-04-15 16:06:01	+stal[GL]	i'm an okay runner
2014-04-15 16:06:01	Zenexer	Yeah I got where you were going with it.  I just don't get the analogy lol
2014-04-15 16:06:06	+stqism	The Linux kernel is laced with that shit because of systemd/wayland
2014-04-15 16:06:17	+stal[GL]	it's unfeasible that i would finish first or last
2014-04-15 16:06:34	+stqism	Zenexer: That's how they get around bugs.
