2014-04-18 20:34:31	Petit_Dejeuner	Pupnik, If you're vomiting you need to drink more water throughout the day or eat healthier.

2014-04-18 20:34:44	Alpha64	like funneh military movies

2014-04-18 20:35:32	@Plesioth	may as well get used to it
2014-04-18 20:35:35	Alpha64	no
2014-04-18 20:35:42	Alpha64	you can't get training in two days
2014-04-18 20:35:50	Alpha64	you can get a heart attack
2014-04-18 20:36:02	Alpha64	or dehydration
2014-04-18 20:36:09	Alpha64	which leads to that too
2014-04-18 20:36:26	Petit_Dejeuner	er, that was Plesioth

2014-04-18 20:37:01	@Plesioth	I can't imagine drinking more water than I already do
2014-04-18 20:37:48	Petit_Dejeuner	You carry a water bottle everywhere you go?
2014-04-18 20:38:12	@Plesioth	not literally everywhere
2014-04-18 20:38:38	@Plesioth	I basically drink a lot before working out
2014-04-18 20:38:44	@Plesioth	then a lot while working out
2014-04-18 20:39:32	Petit_Dejeuner	You have to drink it all through out the day!
2014-04-18 20:40:11	@Plesioth	I still drink a ton of liquid
2014-04-18 20:40:16	@Plesioth	mostly water and tea

2014-04-18 21:02:09	Watersauce	you can win by grinding
2014-04-18 21:02:18	@Plesioth	also you have to grind a LOT for it to matter

2014-04-18 21:07:22	@Plesioth	it honestly feels like you're just throwing the same bias of every jrpg on it when it doesn't really apply
2014-04-18 21:07:31	Watersauce	maybe
2014-04-18 21:07:51	Watersauce	I just dislike a lot of jrpgs
2014-04-18 21:08:37	@Plesioth	it punishes you for grinding instead of git gud since you have to grind a lot on any reasonable difficulty (not normal or below) to just tank through it
2014-04-18 21:09:25	@Plesioth	you can do it but it'd pretty much ruin the game for you

2014-04-19 00:21:33	wareya	interping physics causes input lag
2014-04-19 00:21:59	wareya	it's better to run them at a very high virtual framerate and "frameskip" important physics to the rendering framerate
2014-04-19 00:22:16	wareya	that way you avoid judder as much as possible without causing any sort of timing pains
2014-04-19 00:23:19	wareya	relying on vsync also causes input lag on certain drivers

2014-04-19 00:27:33	wareya	delta time is actually the right idea
2014-04-19 00:27:43	wareya	the problem is that it only works on physics which are single operations
2014-04-19 00:27:44	wareya	like
2014-04-19 00:27:51	wareya	speed *= friction; each frame
2014-04-19 00:28:11	wareya	you need to use higher order math to come up with the proper delta time function for more complicated pieces of math
2014-04-19 00:28:21	wareya	like speed = (speed + acceleration) / friction

2014-04-19 20:35:17	factorysettings	or do you just make a list of if statements for each button?
2014-04-19 20:35:35	Alpha64	you poll

2014-04-19 20:36:02	Alpha64	yes
2014-04-19 20:36:28	factorysettings	if it were possible to get the button pressed, would a switch be more optimal?

2014-04-19 20:39:15	factorysettings	yeah, figured. I tried using the thirdperson controller, but I think I might just roll my own
2014-04-19 20:39:29	Alpha64	roll your own

2014-04-19 20:49:38	@Plesioth	isn't there original xbox emus yet
2014-04-19 20:49:43	Alpha64	nope
2014-04-19 20:49:48	Alpha64	i have a 360
2014-04-19 20:49:53	@Plesioth	what
2014-04-19 20:49:58	@Plesioth	I played orta on my old 360
2014-04-19 20:49:58	@Plesioth	=|
2014-04-19 20:50:00	Alpha64	but apparently you can't play after level 6 i think
2014-04-19 20:50:06	@Plesioth	nope
2014-04-19 20:50:08	@Plesioth	I beat the game
2014-04-19 20:50:22	@Plesioth	at least the NA ver is good
2014-04-19 20:50:22	Alpha64	did you have to install anything
2014-04-19 20:50:31	@Plesioth	Nope, don't believe so
2014-04-19 20:50:48	Alpha64	i should try to get an iso then
2014-04-19 20:50:54	@Plesioth	oh well
2014-04-19 20:50:59	@Plesioth	I played on legit disc
2014-04-19 20:51:13	@Plesioth	I don't know anything about how it plays on CFW
2014-04-19 20:51:16	Alpha64	it should be the same
2014-04-19 20:51:28	Alpha64	the problem was with the emulator
2014-04-19 20:51:34	@Plesioth	it isn't always the same, Alpha64
2014-04-19 20:51:42	Alpha64	( the 360 emulates original xbox )
2014-04-19 20:51:49	@Plesioth	yes but you never know
2014-04-19 20:52:02	@Plesioth	first rule of coding: expect unexpected errors
2014-04-19 20:52:22	Alpha64	i feel like i should drop everything and make a panzer dragoon / Rez game
2014-04-19 20:52:25	@Plesioth	for instance there's a lot of ps3 games that won't run on CFW
2014-04-19 20:52:26	@Plesioth	:3
2014-04-19 20:53:20	@Plesioth	but yeah man, if you have CFW it can't hurt to try it
2014-04-19 20:53:29	@Plesioth	all you're losing is time, big whoop

2014-06-07 10:26:36	Tawre	are arrows deadly when shot into water?
2014-06-07 10:27:07	Pupnik_	yes
2014-06-07 10:32:02	Tawre	Pupnik_, really?
2014-06-07 10:32:13	Tawre	got anything i could look up that would back it up?
2014-06-07 10:32:54	Pupnik_	nope
2014-06-07 10:33:32	Pupnik_	just think about it, i mean underwater harpoon launchers basically shoot arrows
2014-06-07 10:33:53	Tawre	Pupnik_, yeash but they're shot from underwater
2014-06-07 10:34:29	Pupnik_	you could also determine this experimentally by throwing a stick point first into water
2014-06-07 10:34:52	Tawre	In addition to physical and technical limits applicable to the range of the speargun under the water, we need to take into consideration also the acute sense of the fish and with it its related reflexes, so we therefore talk about the operational range of the speargun, which is limited to 3-4 m. 
2014-06-07 10:36:39	Tawre	Pupnik_, remember that
2014-06-07 10:36:43	Tawre	if you're like 1 meter deep
2014-06-07 10:36:50	Tawre	then guns probably won't even pierce your skin
2014-06-07 10:36:58	Tawre	as the high powered rifle bullets will shatter when they hit water
2014-06-07 10:37:03	Tawre	and the weaker ones won't have enough force
2014-06-07 10:37:08	Pupnik_	bullets weigh a lot less than arrows
2014-06-07 10:37:13	Tawre	yeah
2014-06-07 10:37:17	Tawre	but they have a lot less drag
2014-06-07 10:37:21	Tawre	and a lot more force behind them
2014-06-07 10:37:41	Tawre	bowfishing is a thing
2014-06-07 10:37:50	Tawre	and apparently you can only really hunt fish that are ~1m depth
2014-06-07 10:38:31	Pupnik_	is that because of difficulty hitting the target or penetration though?
2014-06-07 10:38:49	Tawre	penetration depth
2014-06-07 10:39:10	Tawre	also those are modern bows and modern arrows
2014-06-07 10:39:16	Tawre	i'd imagine it would be even worse "back when"
2014-06-07 10:39:41	Pupnik_	i imagine it would be best using a very heavy arrow
2014-06-07 10:40:18	Pupnik_	i dont see why it would be especially worse back then
2014-06-07 10:40:45	Tawre	lower quality arrows
2014-06-07 10:40:51	Pupnik_	probably a crossbow would be better, especially for aiming down
2014-06-07 10:40:52	Tawre	probably a lot more drag as they aren't produced by machines etc
2014-06-07 10:41:05	Tawre	yeah some ballista type shit
2014-06-07 10:41:07	Tawre	is probably best
2014-06-07 10:41:15	Tawre	but good luck aiming something like that
2014-06-07 10:41:30	Pupnik_	is there any context for this discussion?
2014-06-07 10:41:46	Tawre	well movies
2014-06-07 10:41:48	Tawre	and like anything
2014-06-07 10:41:52	Tawre	when somebody jumps into water
2014-06-07 10:41:57	Tawre	there's a scene of other guys then shooting the water
2014-06-07 10:42:02	Tawre	with guns or bows or whatever the fuck they have
2014-06-07 10:42:07	Tawre	but apparently it doesn't even matter

2014-06-09 06:27:47	Erwat	what do you guys think would be better to do
2014-06-09 06:27:53	Erwat	an application level ping or a socket level ping?
2014-06-09 06:28:53	@[]J	voting "application"
2014-06-09 06:29:08	@[]J	at least when I tried it, socket level didn't behave like I expected
2014-06-09 06:29:11	@[]J	forget what, though ;v
2014-06-09 06:30:55	Erwat	well i'm thinking that application might be better as it'll show the actual ping you're getting to an actual server response
2014-06-09 06:31:02	Erwat	rather than what the socket handler does

2014-06-10 10:39:55	visiON_132	i dont see anything different
2014-06-10 10:40:00	Morgawr	Tawre: yes, re-read what I said
2014-06-10 10:40:12	Morgawr	17:27 < Morgawr> yeah I think it's not a great idea to live in a semi-expensive country like NL and work at a job in a  Polish company (remotely), idk
2014-06-10 10:40:42	Morgawr	my girlfriend gets paid around 2200 monthly as a junior software developer here in Amsterdam
2014-06-10 10:40:44	visiON_132	why would you even think about going to poland
2014-06-10 10:40:44	Tawre	yeah, but it's not "pretty bad"
2014-06-10 10:40:54	Tawre	Morgawr, yeah, but they're both countries
2014-06-10 10:40:56	Morgawr	visiON_132: because there's a nice job there that I was interested in
2014-06-10 10:41:00	Tawre	with average pay actually being ~2200€
2014-06-10 10:41:12	Tawre	while poland is like average pay of ~700-800€
2014-06-10 10:41:15	Morgawr	Tawre: yeah, my point is that it's unfeasible to work remotely for a polish company while living in the netherlands
2014-06-10 10:41:25	Tawre	it depends on what you do i guess
2014-06-10 10:41:47	Tawre	average net salary here is like 780€ here according to this map
2014-06-10 10:42:09	Tawre	we have some people working at our company that the company spends 5k a month on or more
2014-06-10 10:42:13	visiON_132	are we poorer than poland, Tawre?

2014-06-10 15:14:04	Deet-	maybe this is a case of visual studio optimizing the program when you build it
2014-06-10 15:14:06	Deet-	if you're using VS
2014-06-10 15:14:19	Deet-	are you doing anything with controller after you set it?
2014-06-10 15:18:32	Syzygy	yeah
2014-06-10 15:19:13	Syzygy	turns out it's probably because I was in release mode and said optimizations, the collisionDescription was invalid so the characterController was always null
2014-06-10 15:19:26	Syzygy	my character still gets swallowed by the mesh though

2014-06-23 16:59:43	Custos-Mundi	Well, the blinding effect is easy: cognitive dissonance.
2014-06-23 17:00:07	Kebapmanager	exactly, ( didint knew the english term for it)
2014-06-23 17:00:16	Custos-Mundi	We all have narratives that are enabled by cog. diss. and we just never think about it enough that it surfaces, so we all live happily in a lie we call memory or sense of self.
2014-06-23 17:00:19	Kebapmanager	I still find it prrety fascinating
2014-06-23 17:00:35	Kebapmanager	now you going deep man lol
2014-06-23 17:00:49	Syzygy_	question, if i have a vec3Pointer += vec3 * float * float, how can I get this to work without changing the memory adress of vec3 pointer?
2014-06-23 17:01:05	Custos-Mundi	For some people the "lie" just reaches further and encompasses fundamental beliefs brought forth by various factors (education / indoctrination / culture, experience, regret, panic, etc.)
2014-06-23 17:01:05	Syzygy_	*of the
2014-06-23 17:01:36	Kebapmanager	yeah
2014-06-23 17:01:39	Kebapmanager	thats true
2014-06-23 17:01:39	Custos-Mundi	What's vec3? float[3] ?
2014-06-23 17:01:55	Syzygy_	vec3 is a glm::vec3
2014-06-23 17:01:58	Kebapmanager	I think its Vector ( c++ Syzygy_ ?)
2014-06-23 17:02:03	Kebapmanager	nevermind ..
2014-06-23 17:02:06	Syzygy_	it's c++
2014-06-23 17:02:19	Kebapmanager	I know, but I do not know what is glm lol
2014-06-23 17:02:32	Chuck-Norris	what are you even trying to do?
2014-06-23 17:02:34	Syzygy_	it's a math library, basically it's an object
2014-06-23 17:02:47	Custos-Mundi	Syzygy_: your only chance will be to find an overloaded operator.
2014-06-23 17:02:58	Custos-Mundi	Or a way to access the members.
2014-06-23 17:03:18	rawks	its an struct with overloaded operators to simulate GLSL vecs
2014-06-23 17:03:18	Syzygy_	they're overloaded, but not for pointer += nonPointer
2014-06-23 17:03:21	Kebapmanager	derefferecing would change adress right?
2014-06-23 17:03:30	Syzygy_	i believe so
2014-06-23 17:03:44	Syzygy_	I could access the members, that should work iirc
2014-06-23 17:03:50	Kebapmanager	we can print out memory locations right?
2014-06-23 17:03:53	Syzygy_	but I would prefer doing it as a single thing
2014-06-23 17:03:53	Custos-Mundi	Well, that's a solution.
2014-06-23 17:04:00	Custos-Mundi	Hm.
2014-06-23 17:04:10	Syzygy_	I can, actually let me try what happens if i mess around
2014-06-23 17:04:23	Custos-Mundi	If there's no appropriate overloaded operator or specific functions that enable you to do it, I don't see how else you could do it.
2014-06-23 17:05:43	Kebapmanager	IntelliJ IDE - I write comment // WHAT TO DO NIGGA, he gives me " typo in word NIGGA" ....
2014-06-23 17:06:01	Chuck-Norris	typical java
2014-06-23 17:06:06	Kebapmanager	lol
2014-06-23 17:06:21	Custos-Mundi	Have you tried finding the interface for "NIGGA"?
2014-06-23 17:06:27	Kebapmanager	let me try
2014-06-23 17:06:35	Custos-Mundi	I'm pretty sure it's "lower_mammal".
2014-06-23 17:06:43	Chuck-Norris	XD
2014-06-23 17:06:45	Kebapmanager	ahhahahaa XD
2014-06-23 17:07:45	Kebapmanager	wait, there is built in encapsulation in intellJ that I can use lol ?
2014-06-23 17:07:48	Kebapmanager	seriusly?

2014-06-23 17:20:56	Syzygy_	any idea how i can get the camera position from the view projection matrix?
2014-06-23 17:20:57	Custos-Mundi	Seems a bit ineffective, but I guess your strings are short enough so it won't matter.
2014-06-23 17:21:12	hekaronkiros	are small one or two lines phrases
2014-06-23 17:21:42	Custos-Mundi	Syzygy_: has been quite a while since I've done 3d computer graphics. But I assume you work w/ 4x4 matrices all the time?
2014-06-23 17:21:54	Syzygy_	yeah
2014-06-23 17:21:54	Custos-Mundi	Where you have a token m(4;4) component?
2014-06-23 17:22:00	Custos-Mundi	Hm...
2014-06-23 17:22:42	Syzygy_	not sure about the syntax, but yes m[3][3]
2014-06-23 17:22:55	Custos-Mundi	Ah sry, used mathematical notation w/ indexing beginning at 1
2014-06-23 17:22:56	Syzygy_	m[0][0] to m[3][3]
2014-06-23 17:23:33	Custos-Mundi	Hm, I just wanted to suggest "Hey, why not just right-multiply w/ a translation matrix".
2014-06-23 17:23:37	Custos-Mundi	But I'm pretty sure I'm wrong.
2014-06-23 17:23:41	Custos-Mundi	Damn, so long...
2014-06-23 17:23:42	Syzygy_	so am i.
2014-06-23 17:24:32	Syzygy_	with a regular view matrix I believe you can get the camera position from inverting the matrix and accessing [3][0], [3][1], and [3][2]
2014-06-23 17:24:53	Syzygy_	but I'm unsure about what happens if i do that with a view projection matrix
2014-06-23 17:26:14	Custos-Mundi	Well, unfortunately I won't be of much help in that regard. But ty for reminding me to brush up on it :)
2014-06-23 17:26:42	Syzygy_	uuuhm... glad i could help i guess
2014-06-23 17:26:56	Custos-Mundi	:))
2014-06-23 17:34:04	hekaronkiros	I need placeholder screens for game over and win scenarios
2014-06-23 17:34:13	hekaronkiros	does anybody know where I can get some cool ones?
2014-06-23 17:42:37	Alpha64	ms paint
2014-06-23 17:43:57	hekaronkiros	I want something that looks cool and doesn't take more than 1 minutes to make
