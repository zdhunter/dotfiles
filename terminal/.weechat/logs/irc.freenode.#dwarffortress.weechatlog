2015-11-01 19:27:25	Skid	Very high.
2015-11-01 19:27:57	Skid	Dwarf pathfinding and water simulation eats CPU alive.
2015-11-01 19:28:47	zlug	lol water simulation...  erhrh 
2015-11-01 19:29:43	zlug	sorry  it just seemed odd that the overworld screen is eating up so much cpu time.  are you being serious or is my system screwed up?
2015-11-01 19:30:00	TheBloke	And there's almost no multi-threading, so the number of cores you have is pretty irrelevant.  Having dual core helps a little, as the graphic rendering happens in a second core, but that is usually only a small amount of processing.   I've overclocked my (admittedly a few years old) quad core CPU to 4.2ghz and I'm still lucky to get 30 FPS a few years into a 3x3 embark with temperature 
2015-11-01 19:30:00	TheBloke	and weather turned off.  
2015-11-01 19:30:51	zlug	most of the cpu time is in x11 it would seem  :(
2015-11-01 19:31:23	TheBloke	zlug: When the game is active (not paused), it always uses 100% of one core for me.  What computational FPS I get is the variable, not the overall CPU usage
2015-11-01 19:32:13	TheBloke	I don't know how it shows up on Linux,  but it does sound surprising that x11 is using more CPU than DF
2015-11-01 19:32:23	zlug	i'm getting 97% x11  48% df
2015-11-01 19:32:29	zlug	fucking hate x0rg uggh

2015-11-01 19:33:34	TheBloke	Maybe you're not getting any GPU hardware encoding?  What graphics mode do you have set?
2015-11-01 19:33:36	zlug	which is an x11 font renderer iirc
2015-11-01 19:33:54	zlug	2D, i set it back to default when i couldn't get text mode to work
2015-11-01 19:34:34	TheBloke	I think 2D is the non-OpenGL mode?  have you tried STANDARD?   Or inded, have you tried DFHack with TWBT, which is also an OpenGL mode I believe and also looks a lot nicer
2015-11-01 19:36:27	TheBloke	Yeah, from init.txt "However, all 2D modes are normally far slower than even STANDARD, which may be the slowest OpenGL mode."
2015-11-01 19:37:42	TheBloke	I'm not sure what OpenGL modes it is saying are faster than STANDARD - maybe VBO for example?  I've not used any of those, I started immediately with TWBT mode via DFHack - as provided by the PereidexisErrant's PyLNP starter pack (which I think is Windows only but there's a Linux equivalent)
2015-11-01 19:38:18	TheBloke	But am fairly confident in saying that STANDARD should definitely use less CPU than 2D, because then it should be GPU accelerated rather than 100% on the CPU.  That x11 usage should drop down a lot.
2015-11-01 19:38:50	zlug	ok testing out standard now
2015-11-01 19:39:00	zlug	thanks TheBloke 
2015-11-01 19:39:52	zlug	yep, x11 is now very dteady at 35-38 % of one core
2015-11-01 19:39:54	zlug	steady
2015-11-01 19:40:30	zlug	much better , thanks a million
2015-11-01 19:45:04	TheBloke	Good stuff.  Do consider getting DFHack + TWBT though.  It might be faster than STANDARD (given STANDARD is apparently the slowest accelerated mode), and even if its not, it looks way better and provides for more sophisticated tilesets.  
2015-11-01 19:45:07	TheBloke	I'm still quite new and I don't fully understand what it does, but I do know that a) it ensures text always displays as text when using graphical tilesets (eg you don't see a picture of a coffin instead of the number 0), b) it allows you to smoothly zoom the graphical part of the screen without the text parts (sidebar menu) getting stupidly large or small,  c) it provides a system of 
2015-11-01 19:45:07	TheBloke	tileset overrides that some tileset creators are using to make more sophisticated graphical sets - Spacefox is the one I use

2015-11-01 19:51:36	lethosor	incidentally, DF falls back to STANDARD if it doesn't recognize your PRINT_MODE setting, which is what twbt takes advantage of (since it relies on opengl)
2015-11-01 19:52:39	TheBloke	lethosor: Ah good to know.  init.txt says STANDARD is the slowest of the OpenGL modes - a) what modes are faster,  b) does TWBT use one of those fastest modes, or is it using a modified STANDARD?

2015-11-01 19:54:04	lethosor	VBO/ACCUM_BUFFER/FRAME_BUFFER are OpenGL-based and probably faster, but also less reliable/available (there were memory leaks present in a few at one point)
2015-11-01 19:54:59	lethosor	twbt uses STANDARD in a sense, since that what DF uses when it sees PRINT_MODE:TWBT, but it's probably a little slower due to the extra logic it adds

2015-11-03 05:28:49	LordRatte	Why would you want that? 
2015-11-03 05:29:20	LordRatte	Out of curiosity's sake. 
2015-11-03 05:30:55	Japa	Armok Vision reasons
2015-11-03 05:31:02	Japa	I need to see how they look in memory
2015-11-03 05:31:51	Japa	So far I've seen the vertical ones
2015-11-03 05:32:25	LordRatte	I didn't even know you could make them horizontal, Japa. 
2015-11-03 05:32:51	Japa	They get an automatic orientation
2015-11-03 05:33:15	Japa	Based on wind
2015-11-03 05:33:26	LordRatte	I see. 
2015-11-03 05:33:50	LordRatte	Is Armok Vision a program? 
2015-11-03 05:35:41	Pantsu	yes
2015-11-03 05:36:13	Pantsu	first hit on ddg: https://github.com/JapaMala/armok-vision
2015-11-03 05:39:43	LordRatte	So it's your software, Japa?

2015-11-03 05:43:50	LordRatte	Doesn't it modify the game, TheBloke? 
2015-11-03 05:44:06	Japa	LordRatte, in some ways
2015-11-03 05:44:09	LordRatte	As in, mod it. 
2015-11-03 05:44:28	Pantsu	dfhack is handy anyway so you should grab it
2015-11-03 05:44:32	Nitrodev	it makes it better
2015-11-03 05:44:35	Nitrodev	also hi
2015-11-03 05:44:38	Pantsu	even if av doesn't require it
2015-11-03 05:44:41	TheBloke	Everything is optional.  Few of the features would be considered major mods, and those that are are labelled as such
2015-11-03 05:45:04	Pantsu	dfhack is worth it just for the better building interface
2015-11-03 05:45:11	Pantsu	and being able to search the stocks and trade menus

2015-11-03 05:45:37	TheBloke	Absolutely everything it offers is something that Toady could have implemented and might in future.  If it didn't label all its changes  "DFHack", a new comer to the game who launched DF with DFHack would have no clue what was DF and what was DFHack
2015-11-03 05:45:57	Nitrodev	what does it mean when it announces not enough free nestbox zones found
2015-11-03 05:46:07	Nitrodev	on start up
2015-11-03 05:47:03	LordRatte	Does it change the engine as well, TheBloke? 
2015-11-03 05:47:12	TheBloke	Nitrodev: that's DFHack's autonestbox script running, as enabled by your selecting PyLNP's option of "other automation plugins".   It means you have some birds that can lay eggs, but no nest boxes.  Set them up according to http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Nest_box and a) that message won't reoccur, and b) your egg laying beds that are not pastured will move to nest boxes 
2015-11-03 05:47:12	TheBloke	to lay eggs
2015-11-03 05:47:23	TheBloke	LordRatte: what do you mean by the engine, specifically?
2015-11-03 05:48:10	TheBloke	Nitrodev: or if you don't want autonestbox, edit PyLNP_dfhack_onLoad.init to remove it
2015-11-03 05:48:29	LordRatte	The game mechanics, physics, AI and/or new content.

2015-11-03 05:56:34	TheBloke	LordRatte: No, not really any of that.  It's 90% UI stuff, including quite advanced changes to the UI which can be considered features and change the way you play the game: for example, Workflow which automates the stopping and starting of Workshop jobs according to your current stock levels, allowing you to always keep a specified amount of surplus of most items, and not have to run 
2015-11-03 05:56:34	TheBloke	round your shops adding/removing jobs as you run out of thread to turn into cloth to turn into clothes etc. And/or, don't get drowned in excess items from leaving all jobs running permanently
2015-11-03 05:57:27	TheBloke	LordRatte: there are a small handful of changes that are labelled 'mods', as in they add or change game content.  These are disabled by default and clearly labelled as mods in the documentation.  For example, an advanced and much superior Siege Engine, mcuh better than the default in-game one.   They're optional so if you wnat to ensure you're playing vanilla, just don't turn them on.
2015-11-03 05:57:30	LordRatte	Where's the fun in that?

2015-11-03 05:59:25	TheBloke	LordRatte: Seriously?  Well, don't use it if you don't want it of course, nothing is turned on automatically.  But personlly I don't find it fun micromanaging stuff that can be automated so easily. I'd rather be designing some new expansion, or a devious new system of traps, then mechanically turning jobs on and off because I do or don't have a certain amount of a  given item.  Getting 
2015-11-03 05:59:25	TheBloke	a nicely set up Workflow system, with production automatically responding to the ebb and flow of demand is much more satisfying to me than running round like a mad thing doing repetitive tasks that a 3 year old could manage just as well

2015-11-03 06:04:28	TheBloke	Sure, Losing because you didn't design the defences right; losing because you dug too deep and over stretched yourself, or accidentally flooded your fort.  But losing because six game months ago your food production jobs suspended due to lack of resources and you forgot to re-enable them - that's just tedious, in my opinion.  But of course, each to their own, and DFHack forces nothing 
2015-11-03 06:04:28	TheBloke	upon you.  Workflow does nothing until you start adding rules to it, and it's not even enabled in the default dfhack init file

2015-11-03 09:19:11	Pici	I should try the bucket method. floodgates always takes more mechanisms than I expect and dwarves are slow at making them
2015-11-03 09:21:18	Tohuwabohu	wow, my king is frustrated that nobody could be punished
2015-11-03 09:23:01	Pantsu	make 3x3 room, hole in center roof tile, 4 pond zones around the hole, ???, booze!
2015-11-03 09:23:02	Anarchid	Pici: use bridges instead of floodgates! bridges are like magma!
2015-11-03 09:23:15	Pici	Anarchid: those take even longer to build!
2015-11-03 09:23:17	Anarchid	enemies? annihilate with bridge! trash? atom-smash!
2015-11-03 09:23:19	TheBloke	My King was a bastard. He kept demanding Large Gems, which are only produced like 10% of the time or something like that.  I had four jewellers working round the clock and it still was not enough to meet some of his demands for 2 or 3 large gems at a time.  And then to add insult to injury, he forbid the export of Large Gems, making all that had been produced absolutely useless.  I tried 
2015-11-03 09:23:19	TheBloke	making *him* a gem cutter, and stopping all other gem cutters, but that resulted in the Captain of the Guard picking someone completely random to send to jail
2015-11-03 09:23:33	Anarchid	Pici:  exactly the same amount of labor,actually
2015-11-03 09:23:33	TheBloke	So eventually the King fell down a mysterious hole in his bedroom onto some spikes.
2015-11-03 09:23:51	Pantsu	can do larger, but it requires an exponentially increase in the dowarf power needed to haul buckets
2015-11-03 09:24:04	Pantsu	dwarf*
2015-11-03 09:24:27	Anarchid	dunno i usually have waterfalls and water curtains and swimming pools anyway
2015-11-03 09:24:31	Pantsu	with some luck you *might* be able to do 5x5 with just a single hole and 4 zones
2015-11-03 09:24:34	Anarchid	it just doesn't feel like home without a proper water infra
2015-11-03 09:24:57	Anarchid	so adding a subsystem to generate mud sounds like easy side project
2015-11-03 09:24:57	ORCACommander	TheBloke: well done
2015-11-03 09:25:02	Pantsu	must be 4 seperate zones btw, since only a single dwarf will fill each zone at a time
2015-11-03 09:25:07	Pici	:/
2015-11-03 09:25:14	Pantsu	and with just one the water will evaporate too fast

2015-11-03 09:28:29	TheBloke	Pantsu: several imprisoned, and one dead jeweller (I ran out of chains) is, to my mind, already the extreme.  It's not like the King provides any benefit, he doesn't even bring happy thoughts.  (And he really should, or at least negative thoughts without one.  Currently the nobility are mostly pointless, except the bookkeeper and manager and captain of the guard.  But the mayor, king 
2015-11-03 09:28:29	TheBloke	etc only detract, they don't add - and don't detract in a fun way, in my view.  All those mandates/demands are just micro managing for hte player. It would be more fun if the dwarves responded to them themselves, and they were more varied and made more sense
2015-11-03 09:28:56	TheBloke	So I have no qualms about killing my king in the current way of things.  But yes, the economy did sound awesome (had it worked.)   Far more interesting and dynamic environment. I  hope he tries and brings it back sometime
2015-11-03 09:28:57	Pantsu	TheBloke: nha
2015-11-03 09:29:01	Pantsu	dwarfs are expendable
2015-11-03 09:29:42	Pantsu	it mostly worked as long as you didn't let your dwarfs get their hands on any coins
2015-11-03 09:29:46	TheBloke	But that's the point - the King is *more* expendable than my Legendary gem cutter/setter :) At least the way the game works now
2015-11-03 09:29:48	Pantsu	they would shop on credit just fine
2015-11-03 09:30:04	Pantsu	TheBloke: that is the elf in you talking!
2015-11-03 09:32:24	TheBloke	:) I just find it tedious having to micro manage production of items that are completely unnecessary.  A previous mayor had a penchant for ballista arrows. I don't have any siege items, and I'm in a Serene environment. So all it means is every few game months I have to go to a workshop or the manager, queue up three arrows.  There's no challenge or strategy or fun, it's just boring 
2015-11-03 09:32:24	TheBloke	busywork.  Believe me, when the nobility represent something fun (and/or Fun), I'll be all for them.

2015-11-03 14:25:01	lukky513	that's the main reason I stop playing after putting some time into game
2015-11-03 14:25:35	Velocifaptor	Dwarf fortress makes me want to really prioritize my CPU for my new computer. I'm running a 3.1 Ghz right now
2015-11-03 14:25:37	TheBloke	Yeah, FPS is DF's biggest problem. Far more than basic UI etc
2015-11-03 14:25:59	TheBloke	Very frustrating as I'm sure it could be much improved without a vast amount of work just by threading it a bit more
2015-11-03 14:26:16	lukky513	threading *would* be vast amount of work
2015-11-03 14:27:08	Velocifaptor	I imagine he'd basically have to re-write the entire game. I'm not sure though I've only learned some basic C# and Python.
2015-11-03 14:27:22	Velocifaptor	Like not the game logic
2015-11-03 14:27:23	TheBloke	Nah he really wouldn't :)
2015-11-03 14:27:26	Velocifaptor	But the engine
2015-11-03 14:27:54	lukky513	well, it all depends on the code quality, and he only knows it
2015-11-03 14:27:59	lukky513	we can only guess
2015-11-03 14:28:35	Velocifaptor	I can only imagine the 10 year old legacy code is bad
2015-11-03 14:28:49	Velocifaptor	But thats just based on any other indie code I've seen
2015-11-03 14:29:06	Velocifaptor	You generally see massive improvements in code quality over time
2015-11-03 14:29:39	lukky513	yeah, but there's always that one 10 year old layer that no one wants to touch because it works :>
2015-11-03 14:30:58	Velocifaptor	I don't even remember what I write like, a week ago, I spend like 30 minutes deciphering my comments. My math skills are poor though so I don't quickly connect what the code is doing based on the formulas in the code easily.
2015-11-03 14:31:10	lukky513	same
2015-11-03 14:31:33	lukky513	but I don't put much heart into it

2015-11-03 14:33:41	ORCACommander	DF's code quality is abysmal
2015-11-03 14:34:00	Anarchid1	anyone saw DF code?
2015-11-03 14:34:06	TheBloke	lukky513: after 10 years you'd hope so
2015-11-03 14:34:07	Anarchid1	or that's based on reversing?
2015-11-03 14:34:11	TheBloke	ORCACommander: how can you know?
2015-11-03 14:34:28	Pici	I thought I recalled seeing something about the actual code a while ago, and the thought that it was not very good.
2015-11-03 14:34:35	Anarchid1	hm
2015-11-03 14:34:38	TheBloke	Though it wouldn't much surprise me tbh
2015-11-03 14:34:39	ORCACommander	toady has gone on record about how bad it is
2015-11-03 14:34:45	Anarchid1	i guess it mostly matters when you have collabs though
2015-11-03 14:34:58	ORCACommander	toady codes on a technical level. not at a proficiento ne
2015-11-03 14:35:05	Anarchid1	i recently got a guy to collaborate with my AI project because of all the competitors it was the one with readable code 
2015-11-03 14:35:06	TheBloke	Anarchid1: indeed. A one man show has a lot less incentive and impetus to make it neat.  Unless it's in one's nature to make neat code
2015-11-03 14:35:30	Anarchid1	well, one man, across years, is a lot of man-years, and not all of those men have the same opinions
2015-11-03 14:38:15	ORCACommander	Toady's strength is math
2015-11-03 14:38:40	ORCACommander	So he writes code from that perspective
